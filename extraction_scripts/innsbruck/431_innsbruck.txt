$I To my Lady Tuke, after the death of
$I S=r= Sam.Tuke.
$I Madame,
$I I acknowlcdge these are trialls which make
$I Christian philosophy usefull, not only by a re_signation
$I to the divine decree, but by that hope
$I which encouragcs us to expect a more lasting hap_pinesse
$I then any this world can give. Without
$I this wee were extreamly wretched, since no felicity
$I here has any duration. Wee are solicitous to ob_taine,
$I wee f eare whilst we possesse, and wee are in_consolable
$I when wee loose. The greatest conquer_ors
$I tbemselves are subjcet to this unsteady state of
$I humane nature; lett us not murmure then, for wee
$I offend, and though in compliance to y=r= present
$I sence of things I could joyne with you in greeving,
$I having made as particular a losse as ever any did

<p. 436

$I in a friend, I dare not indulge y=r= sorrows, especi_ally
$I when I consider how prejudiciall it will prove
$I to y=r=selfe and those dear pledges that are left to
$I your care; but I do rather beg of you cease greev_ing,
$I and owe that to reason and prudence which
$I time will overcome. Were I in so good health
$I that I could quitt my chamber, I would be dayly
$I with you and assure you how really I am concerned
$I for you. You cannot doubt the affection of your, &c.
$I Jan. 28, 1672.
