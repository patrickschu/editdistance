$I   Mr secretary, I cam hether to the Hay, uppon Monday last,
$I whear I was very honorably receaved, all the states being assem_bled
$I together for that purpose, to make as much shew as they
$I could devyse of their good wylles to hir majesty, as in many ora_tions,
$I pagentes, and such lyke, was expressed, besyde the people
$I with great joye cryed, " God save the quene, God save the
$I quene," in every place of the stretes as I passed.
$I   The next day all the hole states generall cam to me, and ther
$I openly ageyn ther chauncelor Leonius (some call him Longonius)
$I made a longe oratyon in thankes and prayses to the quenes ma_jesty
$I for hir great clemency, bounty, and goodnes, shewyd to
$I these porre aflycted countreys; attrybuting all their good and hap_pines,
$I under God, to hir majesty only. As sone as he had donn
$I than cam comyssioners from partyculer provinces, as from Utrycht,
$I Geldars, and Fresland, besides sondry spetyall towens, as Anster_dam,
$I Leydon, Auchuson, and others, all which must nedes use
$I ther gratulacion, with oratyons, as the other dede, and much to
$I the same effect all with thankes and prayse to hir majesty.

<p. 47

$I   At all this cerymony-doing was ther a French secretary, sent
$I hether v or vj [days] before with lettres from the king. He sayd
$I yt was about merchantes matters, but in dede contrary, only to
$I have impeached, yf he could, this bynding themselves to hir
$I majesty as they doe. But the states gave him no audyence all
$I the while, alleaging they were occupied about the servyce of the
$I quene of Englond, which they wold dyspach before all princes in
$I the world. This fellow, being present at all this solemne dealing
$I with me, tooke yt in such snuffe as he came prowdly to the states,
$I and offred his letters, saing: "Now I trust you have donn all your
$I sacrafyces to the quene of Englond, and may yeld me some ley_sure
$I to rede my masters letters." They so shooke him upp, and
$I with such termes, naming hir majesty in skorn, as they tooke yt,
$I as they hurld him his letters, and bidd him content himself,
$I they wold first dischardge all the least dewtyes whatsoever to hir
$I majesty before they wold hear him. So they have every day synce
$I sett about the contract with hir majesty, spetyally how to gyve
$I me answere for hir full satysfaction touching ther abyllytye to
$I maynteyn ther warrs, whearin I hear credybly hir majesty shalbe
$I well satysfied, and further then any of us looked for. And both
$I roundlye and frankley they goe to worke, that ye shall se they
$I wyll doe indede more than ever they promysed, considering her
$I majesties denyall [of] the souerauntye and name of protector.
$I For they meane, and must doe it, for the hole people wyll have
$I yt, that hir majesty shall have in hir handes the hole bestowing
$I aswell of ther money and contrybucions as of ther men of warr;
$I and the desire no longer hir good favour to them than they shall
$I deall in all sincerytye with hir. Wherein yt apperes that all the
$I comyssioners have wonderfully sett fourth her majesty to them
$I all here, and Paull Buys hath donn his parte thorowly, so hath
$I Walk also. And all thinges alredy [are carried on] with the most
$I unyversall obedyence of hir majestys name that ever I sawe. And

<p. 48

$I flatly yt apperes now, they wyll no other authorytye but under
$I hir majesty, nor that heir treasure nor lyves shalbe at the dys_posing
$I of any but hir majesty, which, yf you saw that we se here,
$I ye would wonder at [what] these people doe, and ar able to doe,
$I and yf god had not moved hir majesty to send when she dyd,
$I the prince of Parma had byn by this tyme in the best and greatest
$I tounes they have; but ye sahll hear others in this and not me.
$I   And as I wrote before how hir majestyes dealinges here ar
$I alredy blowen into Germany, so this day the elector brought me
$I letters agayn newly com there, whereby they wryte most honor_ably
$I of hir majesty, and the duke of Sax geues much better eye
$I than he did, synce his wyfes death, and lyke to marry ageyn with
$I the hows of Hanalt, a great protestant and a great howse. He
$I hath sent to speak with Seiguro, and very lyke to joyn with the
$I other princes, who ar agreed, not only to send a messenger to the
$I French king, but to lett him now, that they will com to the ayd
$I of the king of Navare, who ys most iniuiously delt withall
$I by the practyce of the pope and king of Spayn. The ellector
$I vowed to me that they have done more in these  causes within
$I this xx dayes, synce they understood of her majesties resolucyon
$I agaynst the king of Spayn, aswell by Sir Francis Drakes going
$I into the indyes as her sending into these countreys, than they
$I have don this x yeres, or wold have don this twelmonths yet. God
$I send hir majesty to think of his mercyfull dealinges accordingly.
$I The king of Denmark also hath joyned and encouraged greatly
$I these princes. Hit ys told me by the elector that dyvers of them
$I meane to send hether to me, to contragulate hir majestyes gra_cious
$I doings toward his countrey.
$I   I have no other nuesytull these states have fully ended ther
$I consultacions, which wylbe to morrow, as I hear, and wholy, with_out
$I contradyctyon, to be at the devotyon and dispocyon of hir

<p. 49

$I majesty absolutly. Of this ye shall hear as sone as I shall know
$I ther further answere. Two of our men of warr of Flushing hath
$I taken ij Dunkirk men; one sonk and drouned all the souldyers
$I and maryners. Thus fare ye well, sir, this last of December.
$I                                      Your assured frend,
$I                                           R. Leycester.
$I   Hit ys sayd that the princes ar resolvyd to entreate Cassymere
$I to be generall, and shall have xxv=m= men levyed by the princes to
$I goe with him into France.
