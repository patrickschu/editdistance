$I Good Sistar as to hire of your siknes is unpleasant
$I to me, so is it nothinge feareful, for that I understande
$I it is your olde gest that is wont oft to viset you, whose
$I comminge thogth it be oft, yet is it never welcome,

<p. 164

$I but notwithstanding it is comforttable for that "jacula
$I praevisa minus feriunt." And as I do understande
$I your nede of Jane Russels service, so am I sory that
$I it is by my mans occasion letted, wiche if I had knowen
$I afore, I wold have caused his wil give place to nide of
$I her service, for as it is her duty to obey his com_mandement,
$I so is it his part to attend your pleasure;
$I and, as I confesse, it wer miter for him to go to her,
$I sins she attendes uppon you, so indide he required
$I the same, but for that divers of his felowes had busi_nes
$I abrode, that made his tarijnge at home. Good Sis_tar
$I thogth I have good cause to thanke you for your
$I oft sendinge to me, yet I have more occasion to ren_dre
$I you my harty thankes for your gentil writinge,
$I wiche how painful it is to you, I may wel gesse by my
$I selfe, and you may wel se by my writinge so oft, how
$I pleasant it is to me. And thus I ende to troble you,
$I desiring God to sende you as wel to do, as you can
$I thinke and wische, or I desire or pray. Frome Ha_sherige
$I scribled this 27=th=. of October.
$I Your lovinge sistar
$I ELIZABETH.
$I To my welbeloved sistar Marye.
