$I My most kind and loving brother,

$I your grace to understand that my lord the king hath

$I instantly desired me to write unto you, that it would
$I please you, for his sake and mine, to send unto my
$I lord Darcy, to deliver Francois Descars, upon a
$I reasonable ransom, unto you; and that it would
$I please your grace to pay his ransom for the time,
$I and that he might be delivered unto your grace,
$I you shortly to have the money again, after that
$I word is of his deliverance, or else he not to return
$I as hither. Furthermore, the duke of Bretagne,
$I otherwise called the dauphin, hath divers seasons
$I moved me to write to your grace for the said
$I Francois, forasmuch as he is one of his servants; the
$I which to do I made him promise, and to the duke
$I of Longuevilee also: for I assure your grace they
$I made me and the noblemen of my company great
$I cheer, from Bologne forth; as the duke of Norfolk,
$I the lord marquis, with other noble men, can inform
$I your grace. These premises considered, I beseech
$I your grace to desire the lord Darcy to deliver, upon
$I as little a ransom as reasonably may be, his said
$I prisoner; for, as I am credibly informed here, he is
$I but a poor gentleman. Now somewhat I would
$I that my lord the king, (and) the both dukes to whom
$I I am much bound, should think he should be the
$I more favoured for my sake. When this man is de_livered,
$I I beseech you to send word by the bringer of
$I this, or some other, what his ransom is, which I
$I pray God may be reasonable and little, who preserve
$I your grace. Amen.

$I From Abbeville, the 18th day of October, by
$I your very loving sister,
$I                               MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE.
$I   To my most kind and loving brother the king's
$I              grace of England.
