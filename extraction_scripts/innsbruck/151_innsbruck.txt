$I   MASTER MORE.
$I   Albeit I am very joieuslx that my procedingis, devises
$I and conferencis with the Ambassadeurs, haue been to the Kingis

<p. 366

$I contentacion, [with th'Ambassadors] in putting ouer, without
$I discoraging of the confederatis, his Gracis entre in to the liege;
$I yet nowe I am in noo smal perplexite howe the same may be
$I continued, forasmoch as commissions and auctorites, aswel from
$I the Popes Holynes, as from the Seniory of Venise, be arrived
$I here, and howerly the Ambassador of Fraunce lokith for the
$I semblable from his master. For nowe, if vpon the exhibition of
$I the said commissions, I shuld not fal in treaty with them, vpon
$I the kingis said entree, there might therby be goven vnto them
$I vehement cause of suspition; which, percase, might dryve them
$I the rather in to th'Emperors deuotion, and the lesse herafter to
$I esteme the Kingis Highnes.
$I   Wherfor I purpose, if it shal soo stand with the Kingis pleasure,
$I wherof I pray you I may be aduertysed by your next lettres, after
$I the French Kingis commission shalbe here arryuyd, if they vehe_mently
$I presse me, to begyne to commone with them vpon the
$I Kingis said entre, for the avoyding of the said suspition. Howbeit,
$I aswel for the ordering of matiers bitwen vs and Fraunce, as for
$I the assuraunce of the Kingis pention, with other thingis that I shal
$I reasonably laye in the waye,I dowte not soo to entrete the articules
$I of this newe treatie, that the tyme of doing any thing this yere
$I shalbe wel passed, or any conclusion may be taken therin in the
$I same. And in my poore opinion, it shal more stande with the
$I Kingis honnor and reputacion thus to procede with the said
$I Ambassadors thenne not to treate with them; considering they be
$I furnished with such commissions, as was or is devised and desired
$I by the Kingis Highnes.
$I   Better it shalbe thus to passe the tyme, and dalye with them,
$I thenne nowe to make any expresse refusal, eyther of the Kingis

<p. 367

$I said entre, or else to delay to commone and treate vpon the same;
$I nam inter tractandum varia occurrere et incidere possint, que rem,
$I vt tua prudentia facile perspicit, citra suspitionem, differe et pro_telare
$I queant.
$I   It is sumwhat to my marvel, that the Kingis Hihgnes, as I haue
$I by myn other lettres signified vnto you, makith difficulte for the
$I lending of the Peter Pumgarnet to the Ambassador of Fraunce,
$I considering the manifold good desertis of the said Ambassador,
$I and the gret profit and commodite that shal arrise vnto his Grace
$I therby. And in my jugement, it is not to be suspected or feared that
$I she shall or may be used by the said Ambassador against the Kingis
$I Highnes, in any hostilite, considering that the suerties shalbe
$I bounde aswel for that point, as for her rediliuerey at the yeres
$I ende; and then there is more lightlynes of strayter collection with
$I Fraunce, thenne of any brech. And where as your lettres purpor_tith,
$I that the Kingis Highnes may haue fyve hundred markis for
$I the loone of the said ship, besides the advauntage of his custumes
$I of his owne subgettis; and thereunto it is to be considered, that the
$I custumes of the straungers amountith far aboue the custumes of
$I his owne subgettis. Wherfor for oon hundred pownde payde by
$I the Englishemen, the straungers payith nyne hyndred. Besides this,
$I I suppose if the King haue, for the loone of her, fyve hundred
$I markis, his Grace must newe rigge, trymme and tacle her at his
$I owne coste and charge, which percase wol surmounte the somme
$I of the said fyve hundred markis; wher as the Ambassadour offrith
$I to doo the same at his owne proper exspress cost and charge.
$I Moore thenne this I cannot saye, remitting al to the Kingis noble
$I pleasour and gratitude; most humbly beseching his grace to haue
$I consideration of such good office, as the said ambassador hath,
$I and dayly may doo, for the advauncement of his present affayres.
$I   I sende unto the Kingis Highnes by my Lord of Exceter, berer
$I herof, certain of the Crownes of the Roose as be newly stryken
$I and coyned in the Kingis Mynte; which be of like fynesse and
$I poise as the Crowne Soleil, and as ye doo knowe, the same be
$I proclamed to be curraunt after the rate of iiii s. vi d. apece. I trust

<p. 368

$I the facion of them shal please the Kingis Highnes. You may
$I shewe vnto his Grace, that I wold suffre noon of them to passe
$I out of his Mynte, and be curraunt, vnto such tyme as his Grace
$I had seene the prynte and facion of the same, and his pleasor noti_fied
$I vnto me therupon, accordingly.
$I   And where as you haue notified vnto me, that the Kingis pleasor
$I is, that his Gracis aunswer to Luthers lettre shold be immediately
$I sent forth to the princes of Almayne, without abidiging or tarying
$I for the copie therof, I thinke therin that meseemeth it is not
$I convenient that this shuld be doon, in my poore opinion; aswel
$I for that Luther, who is ful of sutelte and craft, herafter might
$I percase denye that any such lettre hath been sent by hym vnto the
$I Kingis Highnes, as that the said answer, not having the said copy
$I adioyned therunto, shuld be, for want therof, to the reders and
$I herers therof, sumwhat diminute and obscure and not perfitely
$I perceyved by them that shal rede the same.
