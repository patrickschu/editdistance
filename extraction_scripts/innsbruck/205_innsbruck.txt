$I To the Worshipful his very sin_gular
$I good friend, Maister G
$I of Trinitie Hall in Cambridge.
$I  Good Master G. I perceiue by your most curteous and
$I       frendly Letters your good will to be no lesse in
$I       deed, than I alwayes esteemed. In recompence
$I       wherof, think I beseech you, that I wil spare neither
$I       speech, nor wryting, nor aught else, whensoeuer,
$I       and wheresoeuer occasion shal be offred me: yea,
$I       I will not stay, till it be offred, but will seeke it,
$I in al that possibly I may. And that you may perceiue how much
$I your Counsel in al things preuaileth with me, and how altogither
$I I am ruled and ouer-ruled thereby: I am now determined to alter
$I mine owne former purpose, and to subscribe to your aduizement:
$I beinge notwithstanding resolued stil, to abide your farther resolution. My
$I principal doubts are these. First, I was minded for a while to haue inter_mitted
$I the vttering of my writings: leaste by ouer-much cloying their noble
$I eares, I should gather a contempt of my self, or else seeme rather for
$I gaine and commoditie to doe it, for some sweetnesse that I haue already
$I tasted. Then also me seemeth the work too base for his excellent Lord_ship,
$I being made in Honour of a priuate Personage unknowne, which of
$I some yl-willers might be vpbraided, not to be so worthie, as you knowe
$I she is: or the matter not so weightie, that it should be offred to so weightie
$I a Personage: or the like. The selfe former Title stil liketh me well ynough,
$I and your fine Addition no lesse. if these, and the like doubtes, maye be
$I of importaunce in your seeming, to frustrate anyparte of your aduice,
$I I beseeche you, without the leaste selfe loue of your own purpose, coun_cell

<p. 6

$I me for the beste: and the rather doe it faithfullye, and carefully, for
$I that, in all things I attribute so much to your iudgement, that I am euer_more
$I content to adnihilate mine own determinations, in respecte thereof.
$I And indeede for your selfe to, it sitteth with you now, to call your wits
$I and senses togither, (which are alwaies at call) when occasion is so fairely
$I offered of Estimation and Preferment. For, whiles the yron is hote, it is
$I good striking, and minds of Nobles varie, as their Estates. Verum ne
$I quid durius.
$I   I pray you bethinke you well hereof, good Maister G. and fortwith
$I write me those two or three special points and caueats for the nonce,
$I De quibus in superioribus illis mellitissimis, longissimisque Litteris tuis.
$I Your desire to heare of my late beeing with hir Maiestie, muste dye in
$I it selfe. As for the twoo worthy Gentlemen, Master Sidney, and Master
$I Dyer, they haue me, I thanke them, in some vse of familiarity: of whom,
$I and to whome, what speache passeth for youre credite and Estimation,
$I I leaue your selfe to conceiue, hauing alwayes so well conceiued of my
$I vnfained affection, and zeale towardes you. And nowe they haue pro_claimed
$I in their Title, a generall surceasing and silence of balde
$I Rymers, and also of the verie beste to: in steade whereof, they haue by
$I authoritie of their whole Senate, prescribed certaine Lawes and rules of
$I Quantities of English Sillables, for English Verse: hauing had thereof
$I already greate practise, and drawen mee to their faction. Newe Bookes
$I I heare of none, but only of one, that writing a certaine Booke, called
$I The Schoole of Abuse, and dedicating it to Maister Sidney, was for hys
$I labor scorned: if at leaste it be in the goodnesse of that nature to scorne.
$I Suche follie is it, not to regarde aforehande the inclination and qualitie
$I of him, to whome wee dedicate our Bookes. suche mighte I happily
$I incurre, entituling My Slomber, and the other Pamphlets, vnto his honor.
$I I meant them rather to Maister Dyer. But I am, of late, more in loue
$I wyth my Englishe Versifying, than with ryming: whyche I should haue
$I done long since, if I would then haue followed your councell. Sed te
$I solum iam tum suspicabur cum Aschamo sapere: nunc Aulam video egre_gios
$I alere Poetas Anglicos. Maister E.K. hartily desireth to be com_mended
$I vnto your Worshippe: of whome, what accompte he maketh,

<p. 7

$I youre selfe shall hereafter perceiue, by hys paynefull and dutifull Verses
$I of your selfe.
$I   Thus muche was written at Westminster yesternight: but comming this
$I morning, beeyng the sixteenth of October, to Mystresse Kerkes, to haue
$I it deliuered to the Carrier, I receyued youre letter, sente me the laste
$I weeke: whereby I perceiue you otherwhiles continue your old exercise of
$I Versifying in English: whych  glorie I had now thought should haue
$I bene onely ours heere at London, and the Court.
$I   Truste me, your Verses I like passingly well, and enuye your hidden
$I paines in this kinde, or rather maligne, and grudge at your selfe, that
$I woulde not once imparte so muche to me. But once, or twice, you make
$I a breache in Maister Drants Rules: quod tamen condonabimus tanto
$I Poe[trema]tae, tuaeque ipsius maximae in his rebus autoritati. You shall see
$I when we meete in London, (whiche, when it shall be, certifye vs) howe
$I fast I haue followed after you, in that Course: beware, leste in time I
$I ouertake you. Verutamen te solu`m sequar, (vt saepenumero` sum pro_fessus,)
$I nunquam sane` assequar, dum viuam. And nowe requite I you
$I with the like, not with the verye beste, but with the verye shortest, namely
$I with a few Iambickes: I dare warrant, they be precisely perfect for the
$I feete (as you can easily iudge) and varie not one inch from the Rule.
$I I will imparte yours to Maister Sidney, and Maister Dyer, at my nexte
$I going to the Courte. I praye you, keepe mine close to your selfe, or your
$I verie entire friendes, Maister Preston, Maister still, and the reste.
$I Iambicum trimetrum
$I VNhappie Verse, the witnesse of my vnhappie state,
$I   Make thy selfe fluttering wings of thy fast flying
$I   Thought, and fly forth vnto my Loue, whersoeuer she be:
$I Whether lying reastlesse in heauy bedde, or else
$I   Sitting so cheerelesse at the cheerfull boorde, or else
$I   Playing alone carelesse on hir heauenlie Virginals.
$I If in Bed, tell hir, that my eyes can take no reste:
$I   If at Boorde, tell hir, that my mouth can eate no meate:
$I   If at hir Virginals, tel hir, I can heare no mirth.
$I Asked why? say: Waking Loue suffereth no sleepe:

<p. 8

$I Plura vellem per Charites, sed non licet per Musas.
$I Vale, Vale plurimum, Mi amabilissime Harueie, meo cordi, meorum
$I omnium longe charissime.
$I I was minded also to haue sent you some English Verses: or Rymes,
$I for a farewell: but by my Troth, I have no spare time in the world, to
$I thinke on such Toyes, that you knowe will demaind a freer head, than
$I mine is presently. I beseeche you by all your Curtesies, and Graces, let
$I me be answered, ere I goe: which will be, (I hope I feare, I thinke) the
$I nexte weeke, if I can be dispatched of my Lorde. I goe thither, as sent by
$I him, and maintained most what of him: and there am to employ my time,
$I my body, my minde, to his Honours seruice. Thus with many superhartie
$I Commendations, and Recommendations to your selfe, and all my friendes
$I with you, I ende my last Farewell, not thinking any more to write vnto
$I you, before I goe: and withall committing to your faithfull Credence the
$I eternall Memorie of our euerlasting friendship, the inuiolable Memorie
$I of our vnspotted friendshippe, the sacred Memorie of our vowed friend_ship
$I : which I beseech you Continue with vsuall writings, as you may,
$I and of all things let me heare some Newes from you. As gentle M. Sidney,
$I I thanke his good Worship, hath required of me, and so promised to doe
$I againe. Qui monet, vt facias, quod iam facis, you knowe the rest. You
$I may alwayes send them most safely to me by Mistresse Kerke, and by none
$I other. So once againe, and yet once more, Farewell most hartily, mine
$I owne good Master H. and loue me, as I loue you, and thinke vpon poore
$I Immerito, as he thinketh vppon you.
$I               Leycester House. This .5. of October .1579.
$I                                 Per mare, per terras,
$I                                 Viuus, mortuusque,
$I                                 Tuus Immerito.
