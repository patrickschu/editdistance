$I Address: To my ryght worshypfull hosbond John Paston be thys
$I    delivered in haste.

$I RIGHT wyrshypfull hosbond, I recomand me to you... I
$I was at Haylesdon uppon Thorsday laste passyd and sey the place
$I there, and in gode feyth there wyll no cryature thynke how fowle
$I and orubelly it ys arayed but yf they sey it. There comyth moch
$I pepyll dayly to wondere thereuppon, both of Norwych and of
$I other placys, and they speke shamfully therof. The Duck had be
$I betere than a m li. that it had never be don, and ye have the more
$I gode wyll of the pepyll that it ys so foyll don. And thay made
$I youre tenauntys of Haylesdon and Drayton wyth othere, to help
$I to breke down the wallys of the place and the logge both, God
$I knowyth full evull ayenst there wyllys, but that thay derst no
$I nothere wysse don for ferre. I have spoken wyth youre tenauntys
$I of Haylesdon and Drayton both, and putte hem in confort as
$I well as I canne.
$I    The Duck ys men rensackyd the church and bare away all the
$I gode that was lefte there, both of ourys and of the tenauntys, and
$I lefte not so moch but that they stode uppon the hey awtere and
$I ransackyd the images, and toke away such as thay myght fynd,
$I and put away the parson owte of the church tyll thay had don,
$I and ransackyd every mans hous in the town v or vi tymys. And
$I the chyff maysters of robbyng was the baylly of Ey, the baylly
$I of Stradbroke, Thomas Slyford; and Slyford was the chyff rob_bere
$I of the cherch, and he hath most of the robbery next the
$I baylly of Ey. And as for lede, bras, pewtere, yren, dorys, gatys,
$I and othere stuffe of the hous, men of Coshay and Causton have
$I it, and that thay myght not cary thay have hewen it asondere in
$I the most dysspytuouse wyse. Yf it myght be, I wold som men of
$I wyrshop myght be send from the Kyng to see how it ys, both
$I there and at the logge, ore than any snowys com, that thay may
$I make report of the troth; ellys it shall no mo be seyn so playnly
$I as it may now.
$I   And at the reverens of God, spyde youre maters nowe, for it

$I ys to orybell a cost and trobell that we have now dayly, and most
$I have tyll it be othere wyse; and youre men dere not goo abowte
$I to gedere uppe youre lyfflode, and we kype here dayly more then
$I xxx persons for savacyon of ous and the place, for in very
$I trowght and the place had not be kypyd strong the Duck had
$I com hethere.
$I     The mayere of Norwych dede arest the baylly of Normandys,
$I Lovegold, Grygory Cordonere, and Bartholomew Fullere wyth_outen
$I any autoryte save only he sayth that he hath a comande_ment
$I of the Duck to do so; and he wyll not lete hem oute of
$I preson tyll he had suerty for ache of hem in iiii li. for to awnswere
$I to such maters as the Duck and hys counsell wyll put ayenst hem
$I at any tyme that thay be callyd, and so woll he do to othere, as
$I many as he may gyte, that awe you any gode wyll. And also the
$I Mayere wold have had hem sworen that thay shold never be
$I ayenst the Duck nor non of hys, whych thay wold not do in no
$I wyse....
$I     At the reverens of God, yf any wyrshypfull and profetabill mene
$I may be take yn youre maters, forsake it not in eschuyng of oure
$I trobell nad grete costys and chargys that we have and may growe
$I hereaftere. It ys thoght here that yf my Lord of Norffolk wolld
$I take uppon hym for you, and that he may have a comyssyon for
$I to enquere of such ryottys and robberyes as hath be don to you
$I and othere in thys contray, that then all the contray wyll awayte
$I uppon hym and serve youre entent, for the pepyll lovyth and
$I dredyth hym more then any othere lord except the Kyng and my
$I Lord of Warwyk, &c....
$I     And I pray you hertely send me word how ye do and how ye
$I spyde in youre maters in haste, and that I may have knowlych
$I how your sonnys doth. I com hom thys nyght late, and shal be
$I hyre tyll i hyre othere tydyngys from you. Wykys com hom
$I uppon Satoreday, but he met not wyth youre sonys. God have
$I you in hys kypyng, and send ous gode tydyngys from you.
$I Wryten in haste uppon the Seynt Symon and Jude ys Evyn.
$I                      By yourys, M. P.
