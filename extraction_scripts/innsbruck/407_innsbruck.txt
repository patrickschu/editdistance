$I Gentlemen
$I    since my last to you the House hath been for the most part busied
$I in carrying on & maturing those bills w=ch= I formerly signified
$I to you to be under consideration. To day upon the recommitment
$I I made my second Report of that very good Bill for erecting &
$I augmenting Vicarages out of all impropriations belonging to Arch
$I Bishops Bishops Deans & Chapters or any other Ecclesiasticall
$I person or corporation to 80=li= per Annum where the impropriation
$I amounts to 120=li=, & where lesse to one moity of the profits of such
$I impropriation And the Bill upon reading the amendments was
$I ordered to be ingrossed. After that the House fell upon the making
$I out of the Kings revenue to 1200000=li= a yeare & have voted that
$I the other moity of the Excise of Beere and Ale shall be giuen to his
$I M=ty= for life to make up the full of the said 1200000=li= a yeare.
$I And that the members of the Privy Counsell acquaint his Majesty
$I from the House with their unanimity herein in gratitude for his
$I M=tyes= gracious declarations and Acts of grace to the kingdome The
$I Customs are estimated toward 500000=li= per Annum in this revenue
$I His Lands and Fee farms 250000=li=, The Excise of Beer and Ale 300000=li=
$I The rest arises out of the Post Office, Wine Licences, Stanneryes,
$I Courts, Probates of Wills, Post-fines, Forests and other rights of the
$I Crown. The Excise of Forain Commodityes is to be continued apart
$I untill satisfaction of publick debts and ingagements secured upon
$I the Excise. To morrow the Bill for enacting his Ma=tyes= declaration in
$I Religious matters is to have its first reading. It is said that on Sunday
$I next Doctor Reynolds shall be created Bishop of Norwich. This is
$I all of present news.
$I                           I remain Gentlemen
$I                    Your most affectionate friend & servant
$I                                  Andr: Marvell.
$I Westm: Nov: 27. 1660.
$I I beseech you let me heare whether my Partner M=r= Ramsden be
$I likely to come up or no, for he is not yet arrived. M=r= Wilson pursues
$I his designe for Leeds. M=r= Winchester hath been very carefull in the
$I businesses you imployed him in here.
