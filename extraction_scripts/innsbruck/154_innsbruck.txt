$I   To maister Thomas Cromwell, one of his Maiesties
$I priuie Counsell, Sir Thomas More, Knight.
$I   Right worshipfull, after hartie commendations, so

<p. 181

$I it is y=t= I am informed that there is a bill put vp against
$I me into the higher howse before the Lordes, concerning
$I my communication with the Nunne of Canturburie,
$I and my writing vnto her; whereof I not a litle meruaile,
$I the truth of the matter being such as Grace and I knowe,
$I and as I haue plainely declared vnto you by my former
$I letteres, wherein I founde you then so good that I am
$I now bold, vpon the same goodnes, to desire you to shewe
$I me the fauoure that I might, by your meanes, haue a copie
$I of my bill; which seene, if I finde any vntrue surmise
$I therein, I may make my humble sute vnto the kinges
$I good Grace to declare the truth, either to his Grace or by
$I his Graces commaundement to anie when he shall
$I please; for I am so clere herin that I nothing mis_trust
$I his Graces favoure towardes me, nor the iudg_ment
$I of any honest man. Never shall there any
$I losse in this matter greve me, being my selfe so
$I innocent as Grace and I knowe, by the grace of Al_mightie
$I God, who both bodily and ghostly preserve
$I you.
$I   At Chelsey, Anno 1533, March. By the hand [of]
$I hartelie all your owne,
$I                    Thomas More, knight.
