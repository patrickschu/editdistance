$I MADAM,
$I IT is much your goodnes if I am not within
$I your censure of too much negligence that I have
$I not all this while given you some account of that
$I employment you honored me withall, whearin my
$I intentions wear soe reall to serve you, that I was
$I loth to saye any thing untill I wear better satisfied,
$I which I expected to have found in more forwardnes
$I then I see, although I gave them time to consider
$I of it from the end of last terme till now; and,
$I although I have but a little while to staye now in
$I London, I sett this afternoone apart for a visett
$I thear, that I might thorowly understand their re_solutions,
$I which are, that the daughter must not
$I think of marriage untill her brother's returne from
$I France, which will be this springe. Soe I alto_gether
$I concealed our name and urdged no further,
$I because we have little reason to undervalue our_selves
$I soe much as to importune that which so
$I much deserves to be mett at least half way in. If
$I hearafter you please thear shall be any renuing of
$I this begining, I shall be faithfull at your co(and,
$I professing seriously I should thinke myselfe happy

<p. 224

$I in nothinge more then in those actions that might
$I express mee
$I Your Ladyship's most affectionate servant,
$I             Ju. BARRINGTON.
$I [1629.]
$I To my most honored Lady the Lady Bacon, in Suffolke at Broome,
$I this.
