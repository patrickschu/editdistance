$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I I MUCH wonder the Lady Barrington reseaved
$I so drie an answer from Curtene, for shee was very
$I confident it would have bene thankfully enter_tained,
$I and that an extraordinary portion would
$I have bene given, because shee knew he gave five
$I thousand pounds with a daughter to one that had

<p. 226

$I but twelve hundred pounds a year, and shee
$I thought he would give ratably according to the
$I estate: but this is the cause, I perseave, why he
$I makes a stay; he hath a brother latly dead in the
$I Low Contryes, and his sone is gone thither to see
$I how things are, and till his retorne he will conclude
$I of nothing, for it is reported he hath left him forty
$I or fifty thousand pounds, and then he will looke
$I very hie for his daughters; yet Lady Barrington
$I said he gave her many thankes and did not at all
$I refues, but made a stay; but it is not worth your
$I further expectation. I hope a better will come in
$I your way in the meane time; and, if a good offer
$I comes, I presume you will not delay it, for it is
$I hard to meet with one whose person and portion is
$I without exseption. If some such good occasion
$I bring you not to town, I intend, if pleas God to
$I give me leave, to waight on you at Culford be_tween
$I this and Easter . . . . . .
$I Your most faithful and humble servant,
$I       DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
$I [1629-30.]
$I To my most honored frend the Lady Bacon, at her howes at Cul_ford,
$I present this.
