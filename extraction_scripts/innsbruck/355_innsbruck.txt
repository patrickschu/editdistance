$I MOST DEARE SlSTER,
$I THESE are to intreate you, that, in my absence,
$I you would be pleased to show this letter to Sir
$I Alexander and my Lady when they shall come
$I unto you, which is to remember them of those
$I promises made unto me at my being with them.
$I The first was my Lady whom I did acquaint, I
$I telling her how much my case was to be commis_serated,
$I the promises of my Lord and her mother
$I being now violated, the which they had with soe
$I many solemn protestations vowed to performe to
$I me, concerning the jointure of 200£ a yeare, and
$I that if it should please God to take away my hus_band,
$I what would become of me and my poore
$I children; and withall I told her how much I did
$I relie upon her goodnes, whom I did assure myselfe
$I did love me soe well that she would take my case
$I into her consideration: she said she would do
$I what might be done for me, and that she would
$I tell Sir Alexander of it, who, she knew, would not
$I be against any good that she should intend to any
$I kindred of hers. Then I did breake with him my_selfe,
$I and I must confes I found him very noble in
$I his answer, sayeing that soe soone as he had but
$I settled his bissines, which he hoped to dispach
$I this terme, he would conferme something upon

<p. 265

$I me, which he said must be some of his own in_heritance,
$I for the rest, he said, was all intailed,
$I only Diss, upon his sone, which is 80 £ a yeare.
$I He did solemnly swear to me he would not faile
$I to do for me all that laye in his power, and soe
$I did my Lady too; soe that, when they have settled
$I their occasions, that then they will really con_ferme
$I something upon me. I and mine shall be
$I ever obliged to them, and I am assured God will
$I prosper them the better for their charitable per_formance.
$I And soe, beseeching you to be an as_sistance
$I to me in this bissines, I shall, now and
$I ever, continew
$I Yr most affectionate and truely loving sister
$I to be commanded,    ANNA MEAUTYS.

$I London, May 6, 1633.
$I To my deare and much honoured sister, Lady Bacon.
