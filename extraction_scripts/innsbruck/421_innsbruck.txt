$I For my highly honour'd Mrs. Temple att her lodgings
$I at Mr Winns house
$I neare the horse-shoe in
$I St. Martin's Lane
$I London.
$I Jan. 22, 1664.
$I DEARE MADAM,-You treat me in your letters so
$I much to my advantage and above my merit that I am
$I almost affray'd to tell you how exceedingly I am pleased
$I with them lesst you should attribute yt contentment to
$I ye delight I take in being praised whereas I am extreamely
$I deceived if that be ye ground of it, though I confess
$I it is not free from vanity. I cannot choose but be proud
$I of being own'd by soe valuable a person as you are, and
$I one whom all my inclinations carry me to honour and
$I love at a very great rate, and you will find by the trouble
$I I last gave you of this kind how impossible it will be

<p. 39

$I for you to be rid of an importunity which you have much
$I encourag'd and how much your late silence alarm'd one
$I yt is so much concern'd for ye honour you doe her
$I in allowing her to hope you will frequently let her know
$I she hath some room in yr particular favour, I hope you
$I have pardon'd me that complaint and allow'd a little
$I jealousy to the great passion I have for you and that
$I I shall with some more assurance come to thank you
$I for this last favour of 12th instant, and must beg you
$I to believe that if my convent were in Cataya and I a
$I recluse by vow to it, yet I should never attain mortifica_tion 
$I enough to be able willingly to deny myself the great
$I entertainment of your correspondance, which seems to
$I remove me out of a solitary religious house on ye moun_tains 
$I and place me in the most advantageous prospect
$I upon both court and town and give me right to a better
$I place than of either, and that madam is your friendship,
$I which is so great a present, that there is but one way
$I to make it more valuable and yt is by making it less
$I ceremonious and by using me with a freedom that may
$I give me more access into your heart and this beg from
$I you with a great earnestness, and will promise you that
$I whatsoever liberties of that kind you allow me, yt I will
$I never so much abase that goodness as to press mine own
$I advantages further than you shall permit or lessen any
$I of the respect I ow you, by the less formal approaches
$I I desire to make to you who though I esteem above most
$I of ye world yet I love yet more.
$I I believe ere this you have seen the new Pompey
$I either acted or written and then will repeat your partial_lity 
$I to ye others, but I wonder much what preparations
$I for it could prejudice Will Davenant when I hear they
$I acted in English habits and yt so a propos yt Cesar was
$I sent in with a feather and a staff till he was hissed off ye
$I stage and for ye scenes I do not see where they could
$I place any that are very extraordinary but if this play hath
$I not diverted the Citizens wives enough Sr. W. D. will
$I make them amends for they say Harry the 8th and some
$I later ones are little better than puppet plays. I understand

<p. 40

$I ye confederate translators are now upon Heraclins and
$I I am contented that Sir Thos. Clarges who hath done
$I that last year, should adorn this triumph in it as I have
$I done in Pompey, for I defy Heraclius ? and all his works,
$I having so unfortunately piqu'd Mr. Waller yt he was
$I pleased to speak of me with as little generosity to ye King
$I as he once did of Sacharissa to ye Parliament and I fear
$I his displeasure is no wit abated since ye King's and
$I Queen's so gracious reception of those verses you mention
$I upon her majesties recovery and though this advantageous
$I opinion might have given me some vanity yet Ile assure
$I you Madam yours gave me more and though I never writt
$I anything with more distrust of myself yt since you think
$I them worthy of so favourable a mention I will submit my
$I judgement to you and rather think it possible that I might
$I hit something in them not unluckily then that you could
$I be unsincere to one you are pleased so generously to own.
$I You see how much I depend upon what you say and
$I therefore you ought in honour never to use me with
$I compliment.
$I I am glad of the news of ye Duchesses recovery and
$I the other victory you mention at Court for though it be
$I but changing our pack of cards for another yet time and
$I inconstancy together may at last fix yt passion where it
$I ought to be. I think the conquered rivall has done well
$I in the change of her principles, for I wonder all ladies of
$I her morality are not of a religion which provides them soe
$I many shorter ways to heaven than repentance and when at
$I the wane of their fortune they may retire into a Cloyster
$I and persuade ye worlde yt the shame of their disgrace
$I is only ye devotion of their souls and soe make a virtue
$I of necessity. I am much obliged to anybody for enquiring
$I where I am and indeed if I could give any account of
$I what I doe here I should be better satiffy'd but I am good
$I for nothing everywhere and you will have a hard task to
$I prove there is better company where there is neither ye
$I conversation of towns nor ye innocency of ye fields but

<p. 41

$I a certain kind of busy drudgery to ye world of Fashion
$I for that pittiful nothing that men call pre-eminence with
$I the combined incursions of people who can neither speak
$I nor hold their tongue and yet I could endure the sight
$I of all this here rather than be any more embarquee dans
$I une affaire si mechante as ye combatting gyants, and
$I seeing them devour ye reputations of ye innocent, if I
$I did not consider that by coming to the place where these
$I things are I shall be nearer ye conversation of some
$I particular excellent friends (among whom I assure you
$I Mrs. Temple has a most eminent room) which may both
$I improve and delight me and they so much (byass) my
$I inclination that I cannot but wish Mr. Philips his occa_sions 
$I may permit him to give me yt opportunity this
$I spring and if they doe you are sure to be tormented with
$I me soe much yt I think you are concerned to wish they
$I may not, but in earnest for aught I perceive, I must never
$I show any face there or among any reasonable people
$I again, for some most dishonest person hath got some
$I collection of my Poems as I heare, and hath deliver'd
$I them to a Printer who I heare is just upon putting them
$I out and this hath soe extreamly disturbed me, both to
$I have my private folly so unhandsomely exposed and ye
$I belief that I believe the most part of ye worlde are apt
$I enough to believe yt I connived at this ugly accident that
$I I have been on ye rack ever since I heard it, though I
$I have written to Col. Jeffries who first sent me word of it
$I to get ye Printer punished, the book called in, and me
$I some way publickly vindicated yet I shall need all my
$I friends to be my champions to ye criticall and mallicious
$I that I am soe innocent of this pittiful design of a knave
$I to get a groat that I never was more vexed at anything
$I and yt I utterly disclaim whatever he hath soe unhand_somely 
$I expos'd. I know you have goodness and generosity
$I enough to doe me this right in your company and to give
$I me your opinion too how I may best get this impression
$I suppressed aud myself vindicated and therefore I will not
$I beg your pardon for troubling you with this impertinent
$I story nor for so long an harangue as this, the truth is
$I I would fain by example if I can not by importunity,
$I induce you to yt freedom which is begged of you as soe
$I necessary to ye happinesse of
$I my D : deare Madam, Your most faithful servant
$I ORINDA.
$I To Mr. Temple my humble service I beg.
