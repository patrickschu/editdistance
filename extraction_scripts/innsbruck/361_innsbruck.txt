$I DEERE MOTHER,
$I IT was your favore to me that made me sende to
$I the carrier to inquire after my letters, which I

<p. 282

$I shulde be much to blame to neglect without just
$I excuse, sins you are pleased to give them so good
$I acceptans; but I beleave the carriers, or some be_longing
$I to them, very faulty. I am sure they have
$I been so to me this winter. I had my man Wod_dull
$I at Newmarket this weak, and it was sum
$I trubble to my mind that he shuld com so neere and
$I not waite of yor Ladyship; but his bisnes was not
$I mine, but my Lady Holland's, for she borrod him
$I to go to Cambrey upon the report that the Prins
$I Elector wod not go there. Madam, I humbly
$I thanck you for yor good news of my husband and
$I his bairns, and for yor love and favor to us all,
$I which I beseech God to rewarde you for us all
$I with His saving grace; and I beleave that yf my
$I husband had staide lounger with yor Lap, which I
$I shud a bene glad of, he wod a bene cleane well:
$I but I heare he means to be hear Satterday,
$I therefore I will not write to him. Madam, I have
$I not seene Mr Morse, but I did much feare that he
$I wod be so neare coming up when my husband
$I came down, that there wod be nothing now don
$I in his bisnes: and Mr Morse tould me that yor
$I Lap might have assurance and the remainder set_tled
$I there as well as here, which I was very glad
$I of; for I know yor Lap cannot com here but with
$I much trubble and charge, and we had nede be as
$I sparing of that as we can in small matters, sins

<p. 283

$I nesessity forses us to crave yor assistans in so
$I great a proportion; for trewly, Madam, if you do
$I not helpe, I much feare all will be naught. But
$I trewly, Madam, my husband is very good; but, if
$I he put his estat into a stranger's hand, I shall
$I never looke to see any part of it againe: but for
$I yor favor to me in desiring to keep my joynture free,
$I I cannot saye enuff, but I shall laye it up in a thank_ful
$I harte with yor many other kindnesses. But I
$I hope my husband will be willing to give yor Lap
$I any assurance that you pleas, and trewly, Madam,
$I the more tie you have upon him and his estate
$I the gladder I shall be, for I veryly beleve it will be
$I  [best] for him; and I pray God give us all a happie
$I meeting. But when I think how troublesome I have
$I been, and how unplesing company I must yet be to
$I every body, I recall my wishes, and hope that God
$I will give me that hapines when I shall be more ca_pable
$I of it then now I could, being so often ill: but,
$I Madam, if I do think of any thing that my stomach
$I will sarve me to eat, I will make such use of your
$I kind favour, for which I humbly thank your Lap,
$I that you shall be sure to hear of me. My sister
$I Jarvess and her husband wear with me this day;
$I they both present ther sarvis to yor Lap. Gordon, the
$I oulde blade, presents his humble sarvis and thanks
$I for the chees, and says yor Lap’s kindnes is much
$I more to him then the chees, and that one of thes

<p. 284

$I days he will present you with an eppissell. My
$I Lord Carlell is hugely amended after his fissick,
$I and, they say now, will not die at this time. Sum
$I says hear that the Tresurer's stafe shall be carred
$I by a paire of lawn slevess. I have given my cosen
$I Randolph yor Lap’s letters. I humbly kiss your
$I hands, as
$I Yor Lap's most affectionate daughter,
$I       ELIZA COUNWALLEIS.
$I Pray, Madam, be pleased to bles and bus the
$I babs for me. Sir Thomas Stafford presents his
$I sarvis: he is pitteously in love, and som times he's
$I in hope and som times in despare, and what will
$I be his ende I know not. The Prins of the Temple,
$I they say, has sent to offer his sarvis to my cosen
$I Semer, and they say she has refused him; but
$I they say that by Ester, or before, we shall have
$I two of our French women married to Inglishmen,
$I Crittian to Sr Thoms Shelly's son, and Cattoe to
$I Mr Arpe. The Quene went this day to Walling_forde,
$I but in her chaire.
$I St James's, on Thursday the 4 of February 1635-6.
