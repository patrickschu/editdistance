$I The Queen of Bohemia to Mr. Secretary Nicholas.
$I Mr. Secretarie, I ame verie glade that I shall see my
$I Neece heere so soone, and I thanke you for all your other
$I news. I beleeue Dr. Morley will write those that he heares
$I out of England of Cromwells dessoluing of his Parliament,
$I for being so ungratious as not to doe as he woulde haue
$I them. it was confirmed to me the last night by one of the
$I States Generall, for three of ther Deputies are come from
$I London that were sent about the treatie of the Amb'=ors=
$I and the other disputes; they confirme all, but it was so

<p. 202

$I late that I coulde not heare of the particullars.    the same
$I State tolde me there was a speech of part of the orange and
$I red men in rebellion against his pretious highness.    I pray
$I tell your daughter all this, for I had sealed her letter be_fore
$I I had the certaintie of the news.    I ame verie glad the
$I king resolues to stay at Aix, it is much better then Collein.
$I I heare there is one that has heeretofore served my Lo: of
$I Bramford paked from Scotland to the King but three
$I days agone, and came from thence but sixe days before,
$I he would tell no news but made hast away.    Soone as he
$I went, there reached heere one Thomson, one I haue seene
$I before: he tells all the particullars of the defeat that is so
$I bragged of.  he saith that they were dispersed vpon it,
$I but it as aboue fiue weekes since he came from thence,
$I being come thourough England by his countrie, the bor_ders,
$I where in his passage he mett with a partie where he
$I as hurt and lamed, but for all that he is gone to the King.
$I he much complaines of diuisions amongst them, and not of
$I Sir George Monroe, which they doe also. I doe admire
$I how people could tell so great a lye as the pacquet, but it
$I is verie common amongst my countriemen. - Phil: Mohun
$I is heere, she is fled from England fearing to be imprisoned
$I by Cromwell, shes verie good companie and talkes verie
$I freelie but handsomlie. My Ladie Herbert is also heere,
$I since Sunday last; I haue had yett no time to aske her
$I anie thing, hauing not seene her since Sunday. Thom:
$I Doleman is heere and desires leeue to see me, which I

<p. 203

$I haue put off untill I know the Kings pleasure: for hauing
$I so openlie owned the setting forward of the treatie I will
$I not see him without the Kings approbation. I haue writt
$I thus to your daughter, and desire you both to know the
$I Kings pleasure in it. I entreat you besides to remember
$I my humble seruice to him, and keepe me still in his good
$I opinion, for it is the best seruice and frendship you can
$I doe to
$I Your most affectionat
$I frend.
$I Hagh, Sep. 29.
$I I bragg'd to soone of shooting, for since I wrote the
$I weather has not serued.
$I "For Mr. Secretarie."
