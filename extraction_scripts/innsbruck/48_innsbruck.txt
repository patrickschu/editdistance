$I Address: To my maystere John Paston, the oldest be thys delyveryd
$I    in hast.

$I RYGHT wyrshypfull husbond, I recomaund me unto you.
$I Pleyse you to wyte that on Wensday last passyd Dabeney,
$I Naunton, Wykys, and John Love werre at Drayton for to speke
$I wyth youre tenauntys there, to put hem in confort and for to aske
$I money of hem also. And Pyrs Waryn, otherwyse callyd Pyrs at
$I Sloth, whych ys a flykeryng felowe and a besy wyth Maystere
$I Phylyp and the bayly of Cosshay, he had a plowe goyng in youre
$I lond in Drayton; and there youre seyd servauntys at that tyme
$I toke hys plowe ware, that ys to say ii marys, and broght hem to
$I Haylysdon, and there they be yet. And on the next mornyng
$I aftere, Maystere Phylyp and the baylly of Cosshay com to Haylys_don
$I wyth a grete nombere of pepell, that ys to say viii men and
$I more in harnysse, and there toke from the parsouns plowe ii hors,
$I prise iiii marc, and ii hors of Thomas Stermyns plowe, prise xl s.,
$I sayng to hem that there was taken a playnt ayenst hem in the
$I hunderd by the seyd Pyrs for takyng of the forseyd plowarre at
$I Drayton, and but thay wold be bond to com of Drayton on
$I Tewysday next comyng to awnswere to such maters as shal be
$I sayd to them there, they shold not have there bestys ayen; whych
$I they refusyd to do onto the tyme that they had an awnswere
$I from you; and so they led the bestys forth to Drayton, and from
$I Drayton forth to Cosshay.
$I    And the same afterenon folwyng, the parson of Haylesdon send
$I hys man to Drayton wyth Stermyn for to speke with Maystere
$I Phylyp, to know a way yf they shuld have ayen there catell or
$I not; and Maystere Phylyp awnsweryd them, yf that they wold
$I bryng hom there destresse ayen that was taken of Pyrs Waryn,

<p. 43

$I that then he wold delyver hem thers, or els not. And he lete hem
$I playnly wyte that yf ye or any of youre servauntys toke any
$I dystresse in Drayton, that were but the valew of an hen, they wold
$I com to Haylesdon and take there the valew of an ox therefore,
$I and yf thay cannot take the valew therof there, that then they
$I wyll do breke youre tenauntys howsys in Haylesdon, and take as
$I moch as they cowd fynd therein; and yf they be lettyd therof--
$I wych shall never lye in youre powere for to do, for the Duck of
$I Suffolk ys abyll to kype dayly in hys hows more men then
$I Dabeney hadde herys in hys hede yf hym lyst ('and as for Dabe_ney,
$I he ys a lewde felow, and so he shal be servyd hereafter, and
$I I wold that he were hyre') - and therfore, he seyd, yf ye take
$I uppon you to lette them so for to do, that then they wold goo
$I into any lyflode that ye had in Norffolk or Suffolk and to take a
$I destresse in lyke wysse as they wold do at Haylysdon; and othere
$I awnswerre cowde they non gyte, and so they departyd....
$I    Item, I pray you send hastely word how that ye wyll that we
$I be gyded wyth thys place, for as it ys told me it ys lyke to stond
$I in as grete jupardy in hast as othere don. On Thursday al day
$I there were kypt in Draton logge into lx persons, and yet, as it ys
$I told me, there be wythin dayly and nyghtly into a xvi or xx
$I persons.
$I    Item, it ys told me that Thomas Elys of Norwych, whych
$I nowe ys chosyn mayere, seyd at drayton that yf my Lord of
$I Suffolk nede a c men he wold purvey hym therof, and yf any
$I men of the town wold go to Paston he wold do lay hem faste in
$I prison....
$I    Item, I have left John Paston the oldere at Castere to kype the place 
$I there, as Richard can tell you; for I had levere, and it pleasyd
$I you, to be captenesse here then at Castere. Yet I was nothyng pur_posyd
$I to abyde here when [I] com from Hom but for a day or ii;
$I but I shall abyde here tyll I here tydyngys from you....
$I    Item, my modere told me that she thynkyth ryght strange that
$I she may not have the profectys of Clyre ys place in peasabyll
$I wyse for you. She seyt it ys hers and she hath payd most ther_fore
$I yet, and she sayth she wyll have the profectys therof, or ells
$I she wyll make more folk to speke therof. She seyth she knowyt
$I not what ryght ne titell that ye have therin but yf ye luste to

<p. 44

$I trobell wyth herre, and that shold be no wyrshep to you; and she
$I sayth she wyl be there thys somer and repayre the housyng ther.
$I In gode feyth I hyre moch langage of the demenyng betwene you
$I and herre. I wold ryght fayn, and soo wold many moo of youre
$I frendys, that it were otherwyse bytwene you then it ys; and yf it
$I were I hope ye shold have the betere spyde in all othere maters.
$I    I pray God be youre gode spyde in all youre maters, and yef
$I you grace to have a gode conclusyon of hem in haste; for thys ys
$I to wyry a lyffe to abyde for you and all youre. Wryten in haste
$I at Haylysdon the x day of May. The cause that I send to you this
$I hastely ys to have an awnswere in haste from you.
$I                                    Yourys, M. P.
