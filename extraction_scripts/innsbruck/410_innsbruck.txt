$I To Mayor Richardson.
$I Westminster Dec: 25. 1660.
$I Gentlemen,
$I    Our businesse in Parliament not being yet completed his Majesty
$I hath deferred to dissolve us till Saturday next & we expect that day
$I may hold. For this day and to morrow we haue adjourned. Yesterday
$I (the Excise of Beere and Ale being otherwise expired) his Majesty
$I came about noon to the Lords house & passed onely those two bills
$I of the two moityes of that excise. The one bill taking the Court
$I of Wards & the duty of Purveyance for one moity in perpetuum.
$I The other Bill giuing the other moity to his Majesty for life towards
$I the making up of his whole yearly reuenue 1200000 =li=. The Bills for
$I Wine Licences. For the Post, For review of the Poll, For 6 moneths
$I Sesment, For one moneths Sessm=t= towards expense of coronation,
$I For arrears of twelve & three moneths Assesm=t=, For Arrears of
$I Excise are all ready but not yet passd. The Excise of forrain & inland

<p. 13

$I commodityes 'tis hoped may now fall to the ground. Yet before we
$I rise it will undergo a very stiffe debate on both sides by reason of some
$I publick debts formerly secured & others desired to be added there
$I upon. The jealousy is least this Excise should also be perpetuated
$I For there will neuer want publick debts to be ingrafted upon it. There
$I hath been a motion and likely to be renewd in the House for an Act
$I to impowre Commissioners to receive the voluntary benevolence of
$I all persons through the Country towards his M=tyes= coronation. But
$I we hope it will not take. For though nothing be too much for so
$I gracious a Prince as his Majesty hath been all along to us, yet 'tis
$I good to leaue something to giue hereafter & not to indanger the
$I peoples good will by taking their benevolence. God hath laid a soare
$I affliction upon his M=tyes= family and therein upon the whole nation.
$I The Princesse of Orange dy'de yesterday at his M=tyes= return from
$I the Lords house having bin some fiue days sick of the small pox or
$I meazles or spotted feauer the Physicians disagreeing whether. She
$I was thrice let blood. The Lord sanctify his hand to us all. We
$I remain yours
$I                           John Ramsden,
$I                           Andr: Marvell
$I    M=r= Hebird hath not in all this while seen either of us, so that we
$I are at a losse in his business & can only contribute our good wishes
$I towards it.
