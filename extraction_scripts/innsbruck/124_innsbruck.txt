$I MAISTER Almoner whan the last messanger went I
$I wrote not to you, bicause I had not the suerte of every

<p. 90

$I thing that was doon in the bataill against the Scotts.
$I Now syns that tyme came a Post from my lord How_ard
$I with a writing at length of every thing as it was,
$I whiche I now sende to the King; and ye shal therby
$I perceyve soo grete a gift that almighty God hath sent
$I to the King; for to me it is thought the grettest honor
$I that ever Prince had; his subgetts in his absence not
$I oonly to have the Victorye but also to slee the King
$I and many of his noblemen. This matier is soo
$I mar_velous that it semeth to bee of Godds doing aloone. I
$I trust the King shal remembre to thanke hym for it;
$I for soo al the Reame her hath doon; and bicause ye
$I shal knowe by my Lord Howards Lettre every thing
$I better than I can write, it is noo nede herin to saye any
$I mor of it.
$I M=r= Almoner the King, when he was in Calays a
$I grete whyle agoo, sent me a Lettre touching the matier
$I betwixt my lord of Caunterbury and my lord of
$I Wyn_chestre. I did after his commaundement, and shewed
$I the same befor Sir Thomas Lovell and M=r= Englefeld
$I unto my Lord of Caunterbury, and I prayed hym to
$I geve thanswer shortly, after the Kyngs mynde as he
$I knewe it; for the matier was soo new to me that I wold
$I goo noo further in it. Syns that tyme I have diverse
$I seasons asked hym for the said answer, whiche I coude

<p. 91

$I never have til now; and the same in a lettre I sende
$I you herin closed. I pray you M. Almoner excuse me
$I to the King for the taryeng of it soo long for I coude
$I have it noo sonner. And with this I make an ende, pray_eng
$I you to contynue yo=r= writing whiche is to me a grete
$I comfort, and me thinketh it is a grete whyle agoo that
$I I receyved any from you. At Woborne the xvj. day
$I of Septembre.

$I KATHERINA THE QWENE.
$I M. Almoner I cannot sende you now my lord of
$I Canterburyâ€™s answer, for the cofer wherin it is is goon
$I to my next lodgyng and therfor I shal this night sende
$I it you by post.
$I To Master Almoner.
