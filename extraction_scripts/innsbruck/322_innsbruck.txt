$I DEARE MADAM,
$I I ACKNOWLEDGE that I feele so to the quicke
$I this last afliction God hath pleased to lay upon
$I me as no worldly comfort will ever be able to pre_vaile
$I against itt, for I have lost the best and wor_thiest
$I freind that ever breathed, whom I could
$I not love enoffe for what he was to me, nor suffi_ciently

<p. 119

$I admire for what he was in himselfe and
$I to all the world; nor can I ever by any sorrow
$I satisfie my owne hart that itt is such as I ought
$I to have for such a heavie crosse, which yett I
$I trust will be a means to fitt me the sooner for
$I heaven, because I am sure nothing on earth will
$I ever be able to recover much hold on me; not
$I that God hath not yett in mercie leaft me freinds
$I I love better then ever I did myselfe, but this hath
$I made me see that I must have the best freinds
$I in the world but to loose them I know not how
$I soone, for he that was so sodainly taken from me,
$I both for his years, strength, health and temper, was
$I like to have lived to much greater adge than any
$I I have left, and so I think would, had not his noble
$I hart binne too great for thes tymes and his for_tunes
$I in them. But he is, I doubt not, now wheare
$I nothing of felicity is grudged him, and hath left
$I behind him more trewly sorowfull harts of both
$I nacions then any man's death now living can make
$I againe, and many of us yett know not how to
$I indure one another's sight, being deprived of his;
$I for myselfe I must trewly say I am a maimed
$I body and worse, and so is my Lo. Chamberlain,
$I the last person left of power that I can relie on
$I for the worth of his affection and friendship to
$I me; and, to speake freely to you, the only honest
$I harted man imployed that I know now left to God
$I and his countrie, in which I believe you will hear

<p. 120

$I of a great change before this letter comme to your
$I hands; for I heard this morning from Tibauls that
$I the King was this morning in so weake estate, as
$I there was no hope of his lyfe, though till his 3 last
$I fitts there was no [more] doubt of his safety then
$I of every man's that hath an ordinarie tercian ague,
$I so fatal a yeare is this to great persons as well
$I as meaner. The Lo. therfore give us all grace
$I not to delay preparing to be ready whensoever
$I He shall please to call us, and then the sooner
$I He takes us out of this misserable world the more
$I cause we shall have to magnifie his compacion.
$I Deare Madam, retorn my thankes and affectionat
$I salutacions to your husband, and believe that,
$I though itt will be with a sadder hart, I shall ever
$I continue to love you as your kindnes hath from
$I tyme to tyme given me cause, which is all so unfor_tunat
$I a woman as I am can deserve itt by; but
$I of that you shall never want any real proofe can
$I be given by
$I Yor most affectionat and thankefull freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.

$I I know I need not tell you that I take your
$I kinde sending as kindly as is posible, and
$I that I thanke you more for itt then I can sett downe.
$I More Lodge, this 23 of March 1624-5.
