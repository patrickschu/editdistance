$I   Righte honorable and my singular good Lorde and unkle.
$I Allthoughe I have at this presente little matter worthy the
$I writinge unto yowr Lordeshippe, yet beinge newlie returned
$I frome my poli[sh] journei, I woolde not omitt anie ocasion of
$I humbly perfoorminge this dutie. Wherefore I hum[bly] beseeche
$I yowr Lordeshippe to take these few lines in good parte, whiche
$I I wryte rather to continew this     I ow unto yow then for
$I any other thinge they may conteine in them. The Emperour as
$I I wrate laste unto yowr Lordeshippe hathe these two yeeres
$I continually pretended a journey to Prage, w[hiche] it is thoughte
$I shall in deede be perfoormed, to the greate contentacion of that
$I kingedome, w[hiche] otherwise seemed to bende to disobedience.
$I There it is thoughte his son shall very shortlie be kinge,

<p. 99

$I whome likewise the Emperour seekes by all meanes possible to
$I advance to the kinged[ome] of the Romaines, and for that
$I purpose desyres to call an imperiall diett in Francfort, th[e]
$I   appointed for the elections, but it is thoughte the Electours
$I will rather chose an other for this nexte ensuinge diett
$I whiche is saide shall be sommer followinge at the fur[dest]
$I and then there is no hope of election. Not beinge at Francfort,
$I it is likely it sha[l] at Regenspurg, where I beleve the
$I Emperour will demaunde fur greater summes of mo[ney] then
$I will be grawnted unto him. Thoughe the peace betwixte the
$I Turke and him, as yet as fur as it is knowne perfittlie con_cluded,
$I yet it is thoughte the Turke will rat[her] proceede by
$I sea then this waie, and as the frenche embassadour hathe
$I writtne, mean[ethe to] visite the Popes territorie, perchaunce
$I his conscience moveth him, to seeke the benefitt of Jubile.
$I I hope as the Spanierdes allreddy begin to speake lower, so the
$I Popes holiness[e] will have lesse leasure to ministre such wicked
$I and detestable cownceills to the christ[ian] Princes as hetherto
$I he dothe. Owt of Frawnce yowr Lordeshippe hathe the
$I advertisements fu[?]    the Prince of Conde is retired to Basill
$I where he livethe in companie withe the Ad[mirals] children,
$I beinge frustrate of a greate hope he had conceaved of suckowr
$I owt of Jerm[any] wherein many and wise men do impute
$I greate faulte to the Prince Casimire the Cou[nte] Palatines
$I seconde son, in so muche that to write to yowr Lordeshippe
$I plainely, he is heavilie s[uspected] to be corrupted by the Frenche.
$I His father certainely is as vertuous a Prince as livethe,
$I he sufferethe him selfe to muche to be governed by that son.
$I This I thoughte my dut[ie to] write as havinge hearde it in
$I very good place and muche affected to the tr[ew] cawse.
$I The Polakes hartily repente their so fur fetcht election, beinge
$I now in suche case    neither they have the kinge, nor any
$I thinge the kinge withe so many othes had promised besides that
$I their is lately sturred up a very dangerous Sedition, for the same
$I c[awse] that hathe bredde suche lamentable ruines in France and
$I Flandres. Now the     is reasonably wel appeased, but it is
$I thoughte it will remaine so but a while.
$I   I have no other thinge worthy the writinge at this presente to
$I yowr Lordeshippe wherefore I humbly ceasse withe my dailie and
$I most boundne praier, that it please the Eternall, to continew

<p. 100

$I and encreace yow in all prosperitie. Frome Vienne. This 27.
$I of Novembre. 1574.
$I               Your Lordeshippes moste......
$I                                   Philippe Sidney.
$I   [To] the ryghte honorable and my singular [good Lorde and]
$I unkle the Earle of [Leicester].
