$I    To the most nobly-vertuous and thrice-honor'd
$I              Earle of Salisbury.
$I   Most truely honorable, /
$I               it hath still bene the Tyranny of my
$I Fortune so to oppresse my endeuors, that before I can shew my selfe
$I gratefull (in the least) for former benefitts, I am enforc'd to prouoke
$I yo=r= Bountyes, for more. May it not seeme greiuous to yo=r= Lordship,
$I that, now, my Innocence calls upon you (next the Deity) to her
$I defence; God himselfe is not auerted at iust mens Cries; And you,
$I y=t= approach that diuine goodnesse, and supply it here on Earth in
$I yo=r= place and honors, cannot employ yo=r= Aydes more worthely, then
$I to the commune succour of honesty, and vertue, how humbly so_euer
$I it be plac'd. I am here (my most honr'd Lord) un-examined,

<p. 195

$I or vnheard, committed to a vile prison, and (w=t=h mee) a Gentle_man,
$I (whose Name may perhaps have come to yo=r= Lo:) one
$I M=r= George Chapman, a learned, and honest Man; The Cause
$I (would I could name some worthier) though I wish we had
$I knowne none worthy o=r= Imprisonment) is, a (the word yrkes mee,
$I that o=r= Fortune hath necessitated us to so despisd a Course)
$I a Play, my Lord; wherof, we hope, there is no Man can iustly
$I complayne, that hath the vertue to thinke but fauorably of himselfe,
$I if o=r= Iudge bring an aequall Eare; mary, if w=th= praeiudice wee bee
$I made guilty, afore o=r= Time, we must embrace the Asinine vertue,
$I patience./ My noble Lord, they deale not charitably, Who are
$I too witty in another mans Workes, and vtter, some times, they=re=
$I owne malicious Meanings, vnder o=r= Wordes. I protest to yo=r=
$I Honor, and call God to Testemony (since my first Error, w=c=h (yet)
$I is punish'd in mee more w=t=h my shame, than it was then w=t=h my
$I Bondage) I haue so attempred my stile, that I haue giuen no
$I cause to any good Man of Greise; and, if to any ill, by touching
$I at any generall vice, it hath alwayes bene w=th= a reguard, and sparing
$I of perticular persons; I may be otherwise reported, but if all, that
$I be accusd, should be presently guilty, there are few Men would
$I stand in the state of Innocence./
$I   I beseech yo=r= most ho: Lordship, suffer not othermens Errors,
$I or Falts past, to be made my Crimes; but let Mee be examind,
$I both by all my workes past, and this present, and not trust to
$I Rumour, but my Bookes (for she is an vniust deliuerer both of great,
$I and small Actions) whether, I haue ever (in any thing I haue
$I written priuate, or publique) giuen offence to a Nation, to any
$I publique order or state, or any person of honor, or Authority, but
$I haue aequally labord to keepe they=re= Dignity, as mine owne
$I person safe; If others haue transgressd, let not me bee entitled to
$I they=re= Follyes. But least in being too diligent for my excuse, I
$I may incurre the suspicion of being guilty: I become a most
$I humble sutor to yo=r= Lo: that w=th= the ho: Lord Chamberlayne (to

<p. 196

$I whome I haue in like manner petition'd) you wilbe pleasd to be
$I the gratefull meanes of ou=r= comming to answere; or if in yo=r=
$I Wisdomes it shall be thought unnecessary, that yo=r= LLo: will be
$I the most honr'd Cause of o=r= Liberty, where freing vs from one
$I prison, you shall remoue us to another, w=c=h is â€˜ternally to bind
$I us and o=r=r Muses, to the thankfull honoring of you and yo=rs= to
$I Posterity; as your owne vertues haue by many descents of
$I Ancestors ennobled you to time./
$I              Yo=r= honors most deuoted
$I              in heart as wordes/.
$I              Ben. Ionson
