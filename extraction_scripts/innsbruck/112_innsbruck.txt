$I   Sir Richard Plompton, I recomend me unto you, dessiring and

$I they may be stopped; and that ye will goe to my lord Dayrsse,
$I and make on letter for me in my name, and shew him how they
$I delt with my housband tenaunts and servants, and ye thinke it be
$I to dowe. And I pray you that ye will se that nether thes, nor
$I none other prosses, pas, but be stoppyd, as my speciall trust is in
$I you. For I have sent up the copy of the capias, with one letter
