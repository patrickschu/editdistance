$I ACCORDING to my promise, I will not faile to let
$I you understand of my proseedings last week, which
$I was the first opportunity I could get to come unto
$I the speech of my Lord of Dorset, who was pleased
$I to tell me how much his Lordship had travailed in
$I Mr Meautys's behalf to his Majestie for the making
$I of a baronet, the which his Majestie will by no
$I means grant; so for that I am allredie answered.
$I Now for Sir Alexander Radcliffe and my Lady:
$I so soone as I came to London, I did write unto
$I them, and sent those letters of Mr Meautys's en_closed,
$I which, as it should seeme, they like of very
$I well ; for he is come to London, and tells me the
$I cheefe part of his bissines is to take me down into
$I the country, my Lady being very desirous to see
$I me, so that now I resolve to goe along with him.
$I Thus, entreating you to let me hear from you as
$I often as your leisure will permit, I rest,
$I Your affectionate loving sister,
$I          ANNA MEAUTYS.
$I London, Novr 24, 1632
$I To my deare and much honoured sister, the Lady Bacon.
