$I   (1) Syr. You wrote before in our pryncys cause of your owne
$I mecyon: wherin you schowyd louyngly the daungerys that myght of
$I hys cause folow, but the mater hyt selfe as hyt ys here by the kyng
$I most scharply jugyd you dyd not almost touche.  Wherfor now the
$I kyng, as I haue wryt, requyryth your lernyd Iugement: & that you
$I schold leue your prudent and wytty pollycy tyl you be requyryd.
$I The poyntes be thes, wych though you ryght wel of your selfe know
$I yet I wyl put them a lytyl aftur my mynd before your yes.
$I   (2) An matrimonium cum relicta fratris, ab eo cognita, sit iure
$I divino licitum.
$I   In thys and the rest also, though the kyngys plesure be you
$I schold gyue place to no mannys persuasyon nor authoryte, as I am
$I sure you wyl not; yet for the loye that I bere vn-to you & for the
$I desyre that I haue that you schold se the Iugyd truth, I wyl note
$I certayn placys of weyght aftur myn opynyon in thes thyngys to
$I be consyderyd, euer leuyng your owne jugement fre.
$I   (3) And fyrst, for thys poynt consydur how thys law ys rotyd in
$I nature: pondur hyt by thys rule yf hyt seme to you gu[de]: al
$I thyng wych byndyth man to the obseruatyon therof: al law wryten
$I put asy[de] for the conseruatyon of the cyuyle polytyke lyfe vnyuer_sally
$I conuenyent to the dygyte of the nature of man: al such I
$I thynke ys rotyd in the law of nature. Apply thy[s] rule wythout
$I affectyon & wyth a ryght ye examine hyt in thys case.
$I   And then for the second poynt, an lyceat dispensare, esy I thynke
$I hyt scha[l] be to fynd the popys powar extendyth not therto. And

<p. 29

$I though hyt were expedyent for the wordly pollycy for to haue dis_pensatyon,
$I as hyt was perauenture in the kyngys ca[use], yet hyt ys
$I not expedyent any one man to haue such powar to breke such Law
$I so rotyd in nature, and apon thys ground hyt apperyth to me fer[ther]
$I tha[t] the pope schold not haue powar not only to dyspense wyth
$I any law so rotyd in nature, but also that he hath not powar (nor
$I conuenyent hy[t] ys that he schold haue): ye though he were made
$I hede of the churc[h] powar to dyspense wyth lawys made in general
$I conseyl, catholike lawys, & vnyuersal groundys, ordeyned for the
$I conseruacyon of chrystyan lyfe in al chrystys churche, and though he
$I hathe vsyd the contrary, hyt was, I thynke, a mysvse & vsurpyd by
$I the reson wherof now hyt ys spyd, now hyt doth fal, now hyt ys
$I plukkyd iustely away.
$I   Loke also & pondur thys whether euer the hole authoryte of
$I makyng, of abrogatyng, of dyspensyng wyth catholyke lawys &
$I vniuersal groundys of chrystian lyuyng, were euer gyuen & trans_latyd
$I to the pope by any law wryten in general conseyl, wych were
$I necessary to fynd yf we schold attrybute such authoryte. as to the
$I emperourys we fynd legem regiam qua potestas senatus & populi erat
$I in principem collata.
$I   (4) The second pryncypal mater: - an superioritas quam multis in
$I seculis romanus pontifex sibi vindicauit sit ex iure diuino. Here you
$I must way the placys of the gospel & scripture, wherin I thynke you
$I schal fynd non manyfestly prouyng that; the commyn placys you know
$I how y=t= they are vnderstood contrary therby dyuerse & many, as when
$I the dyscypelys of chryste contendyd for superiorite you know what
$I chryst sayd; you know how poule confessyth [he] knoyeth only christ
$I for heed, cyuyle & polytyke hedys he confessyd many, sed iure diuino
$I nullum. Ferther loke to the begynnyng of the church when the
$I truth therof was bettur knowen than hyt ys nowe. In the actys of
$I the apostylys you schal fynd no such thyng, and aftur the apostylys
$I days the iiij patriarchys of Jerusalem, of Antioch, of Constanti_[nople],
$I of rome had among them no superiorite.
$I   (5) Loke ferther how the grekys fele from the church catholyke as
$I we cal now, chefely for bycause the byschope of rome wold be chefe
$I hede; you know what ys to be gyuen to the jugement of the grekys
$I in the interpretatyon of scripture bettur than I dow.

<p. 30

$I   The contentyon betwyx Petur & Poule takyth away such superi_oryte
$I as ys gyuen to the successorys of Petur.
$I   Pondur why more from the byschope of Antyoche than of Rome
$I such superiorite ys taken a way seyng Petur was byschope of bothe.
$I   (6) Thes certayn poyntys I now wryte to you, non quia preiudicium
$I aliquod afferrent: the kyngys plesure ys that you schold, wythout any
$I preiudicial affectyon taken of any man apon one parte or other, wyth
$I a sincere mynd & wyth that lyght that god hath gyuen you in
$I scripturys & lernyng gyue your sentence. And as touchyng the pollycy
$I of bothe the materys & of bryngyn them to effecte, wych hys grace
$I hathe now dowen whether hyt be wel dowen or yf he requyryth no
$I jugement of you, as of one that in such thyngys hath no grete expery_ence
$I as yet. As whether hyt be conueny[ent] that ther schold be one
$I hed in the church & that to be the byschope of rome, set thys asyde,
$I & in hys cause of matrimony, whether the pollycy that he hath vsyd
$I therin be profytabul to hys reame or no, leue that asyde; only  schow
$I you whether, yf the fyrst matrymony were to make, whether you wold
$I approue that then or no, and the cause why you wold not, & thus
$I wey the thyng in hyt selfe as hyt ys in hys owne nature & put a
$I parte feare of al daungerys, hope of al gud wych schold succede &
$I hangyth apon worldy pollycy, and so clerely wythout affectyon other
$I of kyng or quene breuely gyue your sentence. And thus you schal fyrst
$I honoure god & truth; & second also satysfye the kyng, wych sayd to
$I me thes wordys,  that rather he had you were beryed ther then you
$I schold for any wordly promotyon & profyt to your selfe dyssymbul
$I wyth hym in thes grete and weyghty causys.
$I   Thus you haue my mynd and the kyngys plesure withal, and yf
$I case be that you reche to the jugyd truth, you nede not to feare, aftur
$I my mynd, that men schold lay to you lyghtnes of mynd & chaungyng
$I of sentence, for as fer as I can coniecture you dyd  affyrme noathyng
$I in the cause, as was convenyent for arrogancye hyt any thyng
$I affyrme but only that wych by the word of god we haue declaryd
$I to vs, wherfore you dyd only put before hys yes the daungerys
$I wych hangyd apon wordly pollycy. Yf I remembyr thys you dow, I
$I can not wel tel for I neuer see nor red your boke but onys as you
$I know wel, at the wych tyme hyt semyd to me you wrote so pro_bably
$I that hyt put me in a feare of daungerys to co[me], but I trust

<p. 31

$I the gudnes of god & prouydence of our most wyse prynce schal auerte
$I & turne al suche calamyte by mannys coniecture forseyn from thys
$I our cuntrey.
$I   Dyrecte your knolege yf you see nede by mastur gaspero, the
$I byschope of chete, wyth other such men of hye lernyng and iugem[ent].
