$I Gentlemen, my very worthy friends,
$I    Since my last, the Bill for wearing of Woollen hath been read the
$I third time, past and sent up to the Lords. Also the Bill for continuing
$I the new Impost upon Wines and Vinegars hath been read the first
$I time. There was moreover a Bill brought in to day and once read for
$I supplying certain defects in the French Prohibition explaining the
$I ships to be subject to seisure which fraudently put in to ports & ly
$I there without apparent necessity, and making the Informers part
$I more certain and easy to come by &c: They sent also by some of their
$I members to a Conference with the Lords about the Disbanding Bill,
$I a Provisio w=ch= they desired might in lieu of the Lords Amendments
$I be added to the Bill: whereby in case any part of the Army can not
$I be disbanded by the last of this Moneth there may be more time
$I allowed so that the whole do not exceed the Terms in the Bill above
$I 30 dayes. I heare that the Lords are likely, although it comes so neare
$I to their own sense, yet to disagree in it. The House of Commons
$I haue both to day and yesterday been in Committee about the way of
$I raising the other Monyes. After severall debates, concerning 200000 =li=
$I to be raisd on the new foundations since 1656 within ten miles of
$I London; of making a second Act for Review of the Poll-bill; of
$I laying a further Tax upon Land; the House hath at last Resolved
$I (Agreeing with the Committee) that the 414000 =li= and no more shall
$I be raised by the old way of Subsidy. And they have appointed to goe
$I againe to morrow into Committee in order to the further consideration
$I of that method & toward prepareing the Bill for that purpose.
$I                         I remaine Gentlemen &c:
$I                              Your most affectionate servant
$I                                  Andr: Marvell
$I June 25. 78.
