$I (No address.)
$I Right worshipfull and my singuler good master, in the most
$I humble and lowly maner that I can or may, I humbly recommend
$I me unto your good mastership, and unto my good lady your wyfe,
$I desiryng hartely to here of your welfaire, and also of your
$I good speed in your weighty and great matters, which I have
$I prayed for, and shall doe dayly. Sir, I receyved a letter from you,
$I which bare dayt the viii day of June, and in that letter ye wrote
$I to me, that it was my sone Germyne mynd, and yours, with other
$I his frynds, that I should occupie still att Rudburne, as I have
$I done in tymes, as long as we can agre; upon condition that I
$I wold be as kynd to my sayd son Germyne, as he intendeth to be
$I to me. I pray Jesus that I may find him kynd to me, for it is my
$I full entent and purpose to be kynd and lovyng unto him and his,
$I whersoever I come. But thus the matter is now, that I have
$I taken another house within the Freres at Derby, which is but of a
$I smale charge, and ther I entend to dispose myselfe to serve God
$I dilygently, and kepe a narrow house and but few of meany; for I
$I have such discomforth of my son Thomas unfortunate matters,
$I that it is tyme for me to get me into a litle cornner, and so wyll I
$I doe. I will besech you and him to take no displeasure with me
$I for my departing, for it wilbe no otherwyse; my hart is so sett.
$I Moreover, as touching the custodie of all such evidence, as I have
$I now in my keeping, concernyng thenherytance of my sayd son
$I Germyne, a gentleman of your acquantance, Mr. Herry Arden,
$I hath bene in hand with me for them, and I have shewed him,

<p.191

$I whensoever and to whom it shalbe thought by you most conve_nyent
$I tyme of the delyverance of them, I wylbe redy to delyver
$I them, for I will be glad to be discharged of them; for I will flitt
$I at this next Mighelmas, as I am full mynded, or sonner, with
$I Gods grace. I pray you contynew my gud master, and owe me
$I never the worse will therfor; for it ryseth on my owne mynd to
$I give over grett tuggs of husbandry which I had, and take me to
$I lesse charge. And with Gods grace I shalbe as kynd to him, and
$I to my daughter, his wyfe, as ever I was in my life, as well from
$I them, as with them. With the grace of Jesu, who ever preserve
$I you. Wrytten at Rodburne in hast, the x=th= day of July.
$I By your poore sister and trew beadwoman,
$I Elizabeth Pole.
$I (10 July 1504.)
