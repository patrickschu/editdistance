$I strange newes concernyng a sewte you have in

$I rype in myn owne remembrance. Wherfore I shall
$I moste earnestlye requyre you (the premysses consy_dered)
$I to think non unkindness in me, though I refuse
$I to be a medler any wayes in thys matter, assur_yng
$I you, that (woweng matters set aparte, wherin I
$I beeng a mayde am nothyng connyng) if otherwayes
$I it shall lye in my litle power to do you playser, I

<p. 151

$I shalbe as gladde to do it, as you to requyre it, both,
$I for hys blodds sake that you be of, and also for the
$I gentylnes whiche I have alwayes fownde in you. As
$I knoweth almyghty God, to whose tuicyon I commytte
$I you. From Wansted thys Saterday at nyghte beeng
$I the iiij=th=. of June.
