<The Earl of Leicester to Lord Burghley (1585),

<Letter 11, pp. 21-24.

$I   My very good lord, I am sorry I could not take my leave of
$I you before my departure, but I hard, which I am sorry for, that

<p. 22

$I your lordships paines encreaced after my going from the court,
$I and dyd lett your intended coming to London; but seing that
$I oportunyty taken away, I have thought yt my parte to byd your
$I lordship fare well by these few lynes, whearin I shall wyshe your
$I lordship perfect health, and many yeares to serve hir majesty,
$I comending you for the same to the mightye protectyon of the
$I Lord.
$I   My good lord, I may not, having this occasion, be unmyndfull
$I of these thinges also, which I did think at my leave taking to
$I have remembred to your lordship, albeyt I know the care you
$I always have of hir majesties good servyces. Your lordship can
$I not but remember the cause for which hit hath pleased hir
$I majesty to send me into the Low Countreyes. Hit was not only
$I by your lordshp, but by the hole nombre of councellors agreed
$I uppon, how mete and necessary hit was for hir highnes to yeld
$I ayd and assistance for the relyfe of those aflicted countreys, her
$I neghbours and most auncyent frendes: hit hath grown synce to
$I nerer termes and resolucyons, aswell by hir majesties own wordes
$I of comfort to them, as by contractes sett down betwen hir and
$I them, by hir majesties comyssioners apointed for the purpose. I
$I trust, my good lord, now that I have taken this voyage uppon me
$I to serve hir majestie as she hath commanded, your lordship will
$I be myndfull of me, poore man, but of the cause comytted now to
$I my delinge chifely.
$I   Albeyt I have no mystrust but in so great absence, and such a
$I servyce, I might greatly relye uppon your partyculer good wyll
$I and regard of my self, but in this case I desier no respect nor
$I regard of me, but of the cause, wich I besech you, my lord, I
$I may at this farewell recomend to your wysdome and great care.
$I Hit cannott be but whatsoever lack shall happen to me in this
$I servyce, but the want must turn to hir majestie; and, as ther can

<p. 23

$I no good, or honor, fall to this actyon, but yt must be wholy to the
$I prayse and honour of hir majestie, so whatsoever disgrace or
$I dyshonor shall happen (growing for lacke of our good main_tenaunce)
$I but it will redound to her Majesty also. Her Majesty,
$I I se, my Lord, often tymes doth fall into myslyke of this cause,
$I and sondrye opinions yt may brede in hir with all, but I trust in
$I the Lord, seing hir highnes hath thus farr resolvyd and groen also
$I to this farr executyon as she hath, and that myne and other
$I mennes pore lyves and substances are adventured for hir sake, and
$I by hir comaundement, that she wyll fortefie and mainteyn hir
$I owen actyon to the full performance of that she hath agreed on.
$I Than shall ther be no dowbt, but assured hope, of all good
$I success, to the glorye of God and perpetuall honour to hir maj_estie.
$I   My good lord, you may conceave my meaning without more
$I wordes used to you, and the rather for that I desiered Mr. secre_tary
$I to imparte a lettre to yow I wrote to him. I besech your
$I lordship have this cause even to your hart, as yt doth appear yow
$I have donn by consentynge to the adventure of your eldeth sonne
$I in this servyce; for this I must say to you, yf hir majesty fayle
$I n this service; for this I must say to you, if her Majesty fail
$I with such suplye and maintenance as shalbe fytt, all she hath
$I donn hetherto wylbe utterly lost and cast away, and wee hir pore
$I subiectes no better than abiectes. And, good my Lord, for my
$I last, have me only thus farr in your care, that in these thinges
$I which hir Majesty and yow all have agreed and confirmed for me
$I to doe, that I be not made a metamorphocys, that I shall not
$I know what to doe.
$I   And so the Lord have you in his keping, preserve hir majestie
$I for ever, and send me good spede in this servyce. in som hast
$I this 5th of December, on my way to the sey syde;
$I                                 by your lordships assured frend,
$I                                                     R Leycester.
$I   My lord, no man feleth comfort but they that have cause of

<p. 24

$I grefe, and no men have so much nede of relyfe and comfort
$I as those that goe in these dowbtfull servyces. I pray you, my
$I lord, help us to be kept in comfort, for we wyll hazard our lyves
$I for yt.

<Addressed.

$I To the right honourable
$I   my very good lord, the
$I   lord Burley, lord treasurer
$I   of England.
