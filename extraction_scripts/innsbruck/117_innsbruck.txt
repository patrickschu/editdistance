$I To Sir Robart Plompton, kt. be thes letter delivered.
$I Sir, in the most hartyest wyse that I can, I recomend me unto
$I you. Sir, I have sent to Wright of Idell for the money that he pro_myst
$I you, and he saith he hath it not to len, and makes choses
$I (excuses) and so I can get none nowhere.    And as for wood, ther
$I is none that will bey, for they know ye want money, and without
$I they myght have it halfe for nought, they will bey none; for your
$I son, William Plompton, and Thomas Bickerdyke hath bene every
$I day at wood sence ye went, and they can get no money for no_thing, -
$I for tha will bey none without they have tymmer tres, and
$I will give nothinge for them: and so shall your wood be destroyed
$I and get nought for it. Sir, I told you this or ye went, but ye
$I wold not beleve  me. Sir, I have taken of your tymmer as much as
$I I can get of, or Whitsonday farme forehand; and
$I that is but litle to do you any good, for ther is but some that will
$I len so long afor the tyme. And your Lenten stoufe is to bey, and
$I I wote not what to do, God wote, for I am ever left of thes
$I fachion. Sir, ther is land in Rybston feild, that Christofer Cham_bers
$I wold bey, if ye will sel it; but I am not in a suerty what he

<p. 199

$I will give for it. But if ye will sel it, send word to your son what
$I ye will doe, for I know nothing els wherwith to help you with.
$I Sir, for God sake take an end, for we are brought to begger staffe,
$I for ye have not to defend them withall. Sir, I send you my mare,
$I and iij=s= iiij=d= by the bearer herof, and I pray you send me word as
$I sone as ye may. No more at this tyme, but the Holy Trenyttie
$I send you good speed in all your matters, and send you sone home.
$I Sir, remember your chillder bookes.
$I Be your bedfellow,
$I Isabell Plompton.
