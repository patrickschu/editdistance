$I DEARE MADAM,
$I I HAVE binne hindered frorn sending to you as I
$I purposed, first for want of a footeman, and sinse
$I by the sadde accident of my Lo. of Richmond's
$I death, which tied me to give my tyme to the
$I performance of the charitable offices I could to
$I his La. Now I send with a great deale of earnest
$I longing for the retorne of this bearer, because by
$I your brother I hear you have binne ill since your
$I being delivered; but I truste itt is no other then
$I som indisposition incident to childe bed, and that I
$I shall hear you have recovered better health, which I
$I wish as hartely att the leaste as the continuance of
$I my owne. Howsoever, since the very season of
$I the yeare invites you to itt, lett mee perswade you
$I as soone as you are able to comme to London,
$I wheare the best meanes are for the recovery or
$I confirmacion of your health. You know your olde
$I lodgeings, which, or as convenient a one if I keepe
$I you out of that, shall be ready for you, and I
$I infinitely gladde of your companie and Mr Ba-_con's.
$I I never so much longed to speake with

<p. 88

$I you, and to have you out of that solitarie place,
$I wheare I heare melancholie getts two much ground
$I of you, which is so dangerous an enemie as I
$I extreamlie desier to have you so neare me as
$I I might offer you my best assistance and servis to
$I overcom itt in yourself, and remove the causes if
$I itt be possible. Therefore againe I pray you to
$I resolve to chandge place for a while; som diver_tisments
$I att the leaste you will finde heare, from
$I whence I shall not, I thinke, remove till after
$I Midsommer terme. Som acount of what passeth
$I hear, to entertaine you, I will make unto you.
$I First, my La. of Richmond's, losse, though it
$I weare such a blow from Heaven as I must con_fesse
$I I never knew given, will not kille her, of so
$I strandge resisting stue are our hartes made.
$I She was the happiest woman I thinke that lived,
$I for by her owne confession she acknowledged, that
$I if she should have sitte doune and studied what
$I to aske of God for outward blessings and inwarde
$I comforts of this world more then she enjoyed, she
$I could find nothing to desier but a child; and it
$I was true, for she had of glorie and greatnes as
$I much as a subject was capable of, wealth of all
$I kinds in abundance, health and extraordinary
$I beautie even at this adge, and, above all, a noble

<p. 89

$I husband, that was the love of her harte, and doted
$I on her with the same pasion to the last ower of his
$I lyfe that he did the first month of his being in
$I love with her. Out of those loveing armes she
$I rose not two owers before he died, and left him, as
$I she thought, well, only troubled with a litle paine
$I in his head, which made him desirous to sleep a
$I litle longer; which and his death was so quiet, as
$I his man sitting close to his bedside knew not when
$I he departed, but fearing, because itt was the day
$I apointed for the parliment, that he might wake
$I too late, called in a gentleman of his chamber
$I that used to wake him, who drawing the curtain
$I found him starke dead. I lay by chaunce that
$I night att the Cockepitte, whither instantly this
$I nuse was brought me, and I presently went to the
$I Duches, in whos lodgeings was to be seen all that
$I an unexpected calamity could show of sorrow. I
$I much feared the first violence might have dis_tracted
$I her, but her pasion had so liberal vent
$I as I thinke itt wrought the less inwardly. Her
$I haire, in discharge of a vowe she had formerly
$I made, she cutte off close by the rootes that after_noone,
$I and told us of som other vowes of retired_nes
$I she had made if she should be so miserable as
$I to outlive him, which I hope she will as punctu_ally
$I performe. For my part, I confesse I incou_radge
$I her to itt, which, som say, hereafter she will
$I love me nothing the better for; but itt is the
$I counsel I should take to myselfe in her case, and

<p. 90

$I therfore I cannot spare to give itt. She offers to
$I deall very nobly with my Lo. of Lenox, yett I
$I imagine ther will grow differences betwixt them
$I out of his Lady's over greedines, for they already
$I refuse to accept condisions they had subscribed
$I to, though, if she have not very harsh and unusual
$I measure offered her, itt is in her choise wheather
$I to part with any thing to them or no. My Lo.
$I of Buckingbam hath made his declaracion to the
$I parlement, who yett aplaude itt because itt tends
$I to the final breach of the match with Spaine.
$I The Houses have sitt so short a tyme as what
$I they do is not yett to be judged, but I trust things
$I will succeed well both for the Church and the
$I Commonwealth. The Lord Marquis Hamilton is
$I Lord Steward, so as that staffe hath had the good
$I fortune to passe from a noble to a worthie hand,
$I wheare I hope itt will long remaine. But I fear
$I I do ill to wearie you with so many lines; therfore,
$I deare Cornewallis, I will not for the present say
$I more then that I love you as your owne meritt
$I and the obligacions I owe you justly deserves,
$I and will never be wanting to you in any trial
$I you may have cause to make of
$I Yr most affectionat and faithful freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.

<p. 91

$I Wee have much hope that the Prince will show
$I himselfe of such a temper as will be his owne
$I glorie and the good of these kingdoms,
$I My Lord Steward hath taken from me your olde
$I servant Jeames Henly, and George Purser, whom
$I he should not have had, if they had not binne such
$I as but for his sake I should very unwillingly have
$I parted with. Co(ende me, sweet Cornewallis,
$I very kindly to Mr Bacon; and to my freind
$I Fredericke, whom and the rest of yours I beseech

$I God to blesse.

$I Harington House, this 28 of February [1623-4].
