$I DEAR MADAM,
$I I THINKE myself infinitely beholding to you for
$I your kindly sending this bearer; but indeed you doe
$I me wrong to beleive I should have been gladder of
$I any bodie's Company in my jorney then of yours,

<p. 42

$I and should sooner have invited any of my freinds
$I to have donne me that honor, But till very lately
$I I was not assured wheather I should have gotten
$I leave to goe or no, and, when I did obtaine itt, itt
$I was with this condicion, that I should not invite
$I others to the like jorney, which I do so punctually
$I observe as I take nonne eyther man or woeman with
$I me but my owne servants; so as you see I have not
$I binne left to my owne liberty in this, which if I had,
$I be assured I should have intreated both you and
$I Mr Bacon to have seen the Hage with me, as thos
$I of whos willingnes to doe me all honnor I am most
$I confident, and whos companies wold have binne of
$I extream contentment to me. If Mr Bacon passe
$I this way this sornmer, I wish itt may be while I am
$I ther, wheather, if God give me health, I intend to
$I sett forward from hence on Tusday or Wensday
$I comse'night, and to stay ther till towards the 20th
$I of August, before the end of which month I must,
$I if I live, of necessity be in England; from whence,
$I though ther be litle ods between crossing the
$I Theams and sea, I part not without so settling
$I my estate as, whatsoever becom of me, every one
$I shall be shewr of ther owne, and you not be pre-
$I judised by your kindnes to me, to whos days and
$I comforts I beseech God Almighty to adde many,
$I and to give me means to expresse how affectionatly I
$I am Your most faithfull and thankefull freind,
$I L BEDFORD.

<p. 43

$I I will not faile to obey you to the Queen of
$I Bohemia, nor to make such mencion of you as
$I become my love and knowledge of you.
$I Harington House, this 12th of July [1616].
$I To my worthy freind the Lady Cornewallis.
