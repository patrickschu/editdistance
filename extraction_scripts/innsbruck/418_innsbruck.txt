$I MY DEAREST HEART, - Forby did me great wrong
$I in not delivering the long scrip I sent you, I know if you
$I had seen it before you writt yours would have bin some_thing 
$I longer than it is. But I am thankful however ; and
$I indeed you sent mee very good news, of my Aunt's stay
$I in Towne for the thought of that journey was not very
$I pleasant to me. I am glad you have found a footman
$I too, and Tom shall bee sent up as you appoint, but how
$I will you doe to returne your money. I am in some paine
$I for you. Mr. Lawfort has made up a bill of L15 od
$I money, L5 wee had before and L5 now, and the linnen
$I with some od things you had, buttons, and silke, &c.
$I I sent to our neighbour Mr. Osgood to know if hee could
$I help us, but hee is not provided at present hee says. I doe
$I not think but Mr. Ward of Newgate Markett could doe it,
$I he has acquaintance heare for I have had letters sent mee
$I from him by Townsmen, if you have any from Irelande
$I pray let me have them to entertaine myselfe withall till
$I you come. It seems tis true that my Aunt Temple comes
$I away for my cousin Mary Hammond writes my Aunt
$I word yt she and my Lady Waller were at Battersay to see
$I my Uncle and where they told her they expected her very
$I suddenly. Poore woman I am sorry for her, tis certain
$I the dread of us that frights her away.

<p. 26

$I Jack is invited to Coly a-shroving, but my Lady says
$I she believes she is never to see you there, I sayed what
$I I could to excuse you, but you are concluded the arrantist
$I gadder in ye country, none matter though my deare I
$I love you for all that so will hast home againe.
$I Doe you mean to look for some lodgings and roome
$I to lay our goods in that must be thought on. I "memed"
$I to stand out of harms way when the Great Wall fell
$I downe. Here come Creeper that will let me say no more
$I but that we are both yours. If Tom goes remember
$I Mrs. Fountains hood.
