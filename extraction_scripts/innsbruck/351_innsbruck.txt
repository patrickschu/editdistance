$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I OF the busines I most desire I can as yet give
$I you the least acount, for I have not seene eyther
$I Sir Frederick or his Lady sins I came to towne,
$I onlie ons him in Hide Park with a company of
$I gentlewomen in a coach ; he came and inquired of
$I your health and my cosin's, and that was all that
$I passed: but he was ons to see me when I was
$I from home; and I beleve shortly she will come to
$I me, for I heard she did intend it, but she was ill of
$I a soare throat and the tooth-ache. Some say she
$I is with child. I ons thought to have gone to
$I Grenwich to her because she was not well, but
$I sins I resolved to stay and see what they would
$I doe. The King's being at Grenwich hath made
$I every bodie almost leave London, that I am put to
$I a great deale of troble to find out those that should
$I ende my mother's busines, and the more becaus I
$I have bin ill after the manner I was, ever sins I left
$I your Ladiship at Brome. My Lady Barrington is
$I not in towne, nor will be this tearme; but Mr
$I Randolph has promised I shall come that way as I
$I come downe againe, which shall be as soon as I can.
$I My cosen Peter Meautys hath your letters and a
$I copie of the paper you sent; he staies but for a

<p. 248

$I winde. I spake to Mrs West, who desired me to
$I retorne you humble thanks for your favour and
$I bounty to her and her nece; her house will be
$I emty within a fortnight, she saith, if pleas you to
$I co(and it. I have sent you some patterns of stuff
$I such as is worne by many, but not much laes upon
$I those wrought stufs; but the newest fashion is
$I plaine satine, of what collor one will, imbroydered
$I all over with alcomedes, but it is not like to hould
$I past summer. They weare whit sattine wascots,
$I plaine, rased, printed, and some imbroydered with
$I laes, more then any one thing, and whit holland
$I ones much. Mr Chitting co(ends his Services to
$I you, and will bring the musition with him; which
$I when I have done, and inquired of Sir Charles
$I Seasar, whom he serves, of his condishions, I will
$I send you worde, and will be most carefull of all
$I the co(ands you have or will be pleased to favour
$I me with, or what else may give testimony
$I I am your faithfull frend and humble servant,
$I          DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
$I  [1631-2.]
$I Sins I writ this letter my Lady Cornwalies
$I came to me, but not Sir Fredrick; for he plaies
$I least in sight, for feare, I thinke, that I should tell
$I him his owne, but I am like to doe it the more,
$I next time I see him. I tould his Lady the manner

<p. 249

$I of his carage at Brome, and that it was his own
$I fault he came away upon noe better termes. She
$I professes she knowes his hart much desires a sin_cere
$I reconcilment; and the contrary, if it continue
$I soe, will shorten his life: yet I perseave not him to
$I be soe forward as she; but I know nothing but
$I that he is soe backward to come to me, where he
$I might further that he soe much desires. It will
$I be too tedious to committ to wrighting all that
$I passed betwene my Lady Cornwalies and me; only
$I this in generall, she much desires, as she saieth,
$I still to doe any thing that might give you satisfac_tion.
$I For the money, when she could get it, you
$I should have it; and, if in the meane time the King
$I and Queen's promis from their own mouthes to you
$I will any way give you content, she will not faile to
$I procure that, and she desired me to wright you
$I word soe, which I made answer it was better for
$I her to writ it herselfe. I knew not how you would
$I like it, yet I let it goe on, that you might take that
$I ocasion to speake with the King; and I thinke it
$I may serve you for the money well, and be a meanes
$I to get it sooner then they can otherwise, and it
$I will be a caus that any bodie will thinke sufficient
$I to bring you to towne. My Lady was afraid any
$I thing that she should writ would be unpleasing to
$I you, but I strived to perswade her from that;
$I becaus, if you should accept any thing that she
$I offers, you might have it under her owne hand, for

<p. 250

$I she might forget what she saied to me, and I
$I might be accused for mistaking.
$I I thinke you weare never trobled with so tedi_ous
$I a letter, and therfore now I will conclude,
$I with a hartie wish of all hapines to you and
$I yours; and soe, sweet Madam, ons more farewell.
