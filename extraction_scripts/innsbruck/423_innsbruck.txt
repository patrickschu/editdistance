$I Jan. 28th (1668).
$I So great news as the change of the Lieutenant of
$I Ireland will be in all letters, yet that doe not acquit me
$I from any mension of it Madame, because you did inquier
$I after it in your last to me. Sunday the King at my Lord
$I Keepers dismissed the Duke of Ormond from it with many
$I gracious expressions that it was not for any fault or mis_carriages 
$I of his governing on any declination of his kind_ness 
$I to his person which he would shew by taking him
$I into all his counsels, the Duke of Ormond made a long
$I speech to the King and then complimented my Ld. Roberts
$I which he more than returned, soe very much civility past
$I since he attends the King with the very same dilligence he
$I did before with as much submission and humility as is
$I possible and severetye to his enemies.
$I The Duke of Buckingham has his greatest desire in

<p. 111

$I his being out but not all tis thought because he did not
$I choose his successor.
$I A Tuesday the King dined at the Dutch Embassador's
$I they will all treate him I believe and none worse than the
$I French did except that their cooks are better than others,
$I for 'twas as poore as could be on such an occasion, and
$I the man stood at the doore, taking care himselfe of his
$I plate, and they say to have the sweetnesses saved but I
$I think that cannot be. An old coustom is abolished, no
$I Valentines were drawn out of thrift, the Maydes of Honour
$I have a losse by it for twas their fees, if my Lady Harvie
$I wear not at Arlington House she would be forgot she is
$I gott in a little with the Duchess of Monmouth again soe
$I far as to see her sometimes. She has the courage only to
$I resolve to have her hip set but not to suffer it to be don,
$I when she goes about it, makes litle tryalls and then begs
$I of them to let her alone. This has been a very quarrel_some 
$I week, before the King my Ld. of Rochester forgot
$I his dutye, so much as to strike Tome Keeligrew, he was
$I in a case not to know what he did but he is forbid the
$I court and Brunkard and Sir John Morton were so high in
$I wordes in the Queen's Privye chamber that they were both
$I committed by my Ld. Chamberlain. My Ld. Burleigh
$I goes a-woing as they call it, with hopes that his Father
$I and my Ld. of Devonshire will not agree, he can endure
$I my Lady Rich as well as any other wife, but he had rather
$I have none. If you are as diligent to my ill letters as
$I others that are so, 'tis as much as is due to me though I
$I am your Ladyships very affectionate servant.
$I My service to yr. Brothers and sister.
