$I 'To Major-General Crawford: These.'
$I Cambridge, 10th March `1643.'
$I SIR,
$I    The complaints you preferred to my lord against
$I your Lieutenant-Colonel, both by Mr. Lee and your
$I own letters, have occasioned his stay here;  my
$I Lord being 'so' employed, in regard of many occasions
$I which are upon him, that he hath not been at leisure
$I to hear him make his defence: which, in pure justice,

<p. 182

$I ought to be granted him or any man before a judgment
$I be passed upon him.
$I    During his abode here and absence from you, he
$I hath acquainted me what a grief it is to him to be ab_sent
$I from his charge, especially now the regiment is
$I called forth to action: and therefore, asking of me my
$I opinion, I advised him speedily to repair unto you.
$I Surely you are not well advised thus to turn off one so
$I faithful to the cause, and so able to serve you as this
$I man is. Give me leave to tell you, I cannot be of
$I your judgment; 'cannot understand, if a man notorious
$I for wickedness, for oaths, for drinking, hath as great
$I a share in your affection as one who fears an oath,
$I who fears to sin,  that this doth commend your elec_tion
$I of men to serve as fit instruments in this work! 
$I    Ay, but the man "is an Anabaptist." Are you sure
$I of that? Admit he be, shall that render him incapable
$I to serve the Public? "He is indiscreet." It may be so,
$I in some things: we have all human infirmities. I tell
$I you, if you had none but such "indiscreet men" about
$I you, and would be pleased to use them kindly, you
$I would find as good a fence to you as any you have yet
$I chosen.
$I    Sir, the State, in choosing men to serve it, takes
$I no notice of their opinions; if they be willing faithfully
$I to serve it,  that satisfies. I advised you formerly to
$I bear with men of different minds from yourself: if you
$I had done it when I advised you to it, I think you
$I would not have had so many stumblingblocks in your
$I way. It may be you judge otherwise; but I tell you
$I my mind.  I desire you would receive this man into
$I your favour and opinion. I believe, if he follow
$I my counsel, he will deserve no other but respect from

<p. 183

$I you. Take heed of being sharp, or too easily sharpened
$I by others, against those to whom you can object little
$I but that they square not with you in every opinion
$I concerning matters of religion. If there be any other
$I offence to be charged upon him,   that must in a
$I judicial way receive determination. I know you will
$I not think it fit my Lord should discharge an Officer of
$I the Field but in a regulate way. I question whether
$I you or I have any  precedent for that.
$I    I have no further to trouble you:  but rest,
$I           Your humble servant,
$I                  OLIVER CROMWELL. 
