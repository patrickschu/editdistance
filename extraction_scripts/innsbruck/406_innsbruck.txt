$I Gentlemen,
$I   I have been to day with my Lord Bellasis to deliuer your letter
$I w=ch= with the Petition of the Taylors inclosed he read, and with much
$I readynes and courtesy promised this night by the Post to giue the
$I most effectuall orders to Colonell Gilby that he should fullfill all things
$I as you desire therein as farre as will consist with the Act of Parliament
$I concerning soldiers exercising trades, and particularly witnessed to
$I me his own resolution as much as might be to intertain no soldiers that
$I should haue any trade but that of their soldiery. I received to day
$I another letter of yours of the 17=th= directed to my selfe & M=r= Ramsden
$I who is not yet arrived in M=r= Wilsons businesse. He hath been with
$I me & seems to build much upon my advise. I counselled him before
$I I had yours in any case not to thinke any more of Hezle but if he could
$I (as he said he had some hopes) to make for Leeds upon M=r= Stiles his
$I acceptance of Hezle. I shall be very tender and sensible of your in_terest
$I herein & shall afford him no assistance, but on the contrary, in
$I any thing reflecting upon your proceedings. But as farre as I can
$I understand him, and I shall now be the more watchfull over him, he
$I hath wholy laid by any such thoughts & his whole designe is now
$I upon Leeds. Yesterday after a long debate upon the compensation
$I for the Court of Wards, twas resolued that for the Tenures of Lands
$I in Capite, knights Service, Court of Wards and all the emoluments
$I thereof, and for taking away of Purveyance the king should have
$I in perpetuity one moity of the Excise of Beere and Ale. The other
$I Moity was not then disposed of but 'tis likely will come in into the
$I yearly revenue of 1200000=li= which must be setled. To day we were
$I upon the Act of Militia which is referd to a Committee of the whole
$I house on Saturday next. To day also at a Conference with the Lords
$I his Majestys pleasure was signified to us that in respect of the approach
$I of Christmasse and his Majesties coronation to be prepared for shortly
$I after this Parliament should be dissolved the 20=th= of the next moneth.
$I By how much our time is shorter I shall the more daily and diligently
$I give you advice of all that passes.
$I                        I remain Gentlemen
$I                    Your most affectionate friend & servant
$I                                 Andr: Marvell.
$I Westm: Nov: 22. 1660.
