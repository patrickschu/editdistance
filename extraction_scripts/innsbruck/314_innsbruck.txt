$I DEARE MADAM,
$I I THINKE itt long since I heard of you and
$I yours, whos well beings and happines I most
$I hartely desier, and send this bearer to inquier of,
$I beseeching you to beleeve that no abscence nor
$I lengthe of tyme can diminish that affection in me
$I I have so many years professed and you so well
$I deserved; for, whensoever you shall have occasion
$I to make trial therof, you shall find all in my power

<p. 76

$I in yours to co(ande for your servis to the utter_most
$I it can be extended, and that I shall reckon
$I itt a good fortune to me to be employed by you
$I in any thing that may give you assurance how
$I unfainedly I love you, whereof itt wear an ex_tream
$I contentment to me if we wear nearer neigh_bours,
$I that I might often tell itt you, which I
$I can doe no more. But itt is in this, as much
$I more, my happe to have much of what I wishe
$I not, and want what I desier. Yett I hope eare
$I long sum good occasion will bring you to London,
$I from whence, exsept it be somtymes for a day or
$I two, I shall not sturre till after Easter terme;
$I my neese, her father, and I haveing bargained,
$I she with him for the present posession of her
$I land, and I with her for her posibility in the lease
$I of Combe, which to setle thoroughly, and provide
$I to pay for, will coste me so long a stay heare.
$I This donne, I intend to turn Combe wholly into
$I money, bothe to make myself a free woman from
$I debt, and with the rest of itt to rayse as good
$I an estate for lyfe as I can, having now nonne but
$I myselfe to provide for; those designes I had for
$I my neese being crossed by her father's untoward_nes,
$I and her owne porcion being sufficient for any
$I matche. Nor do I fear finding this any searious
$I worke for her, having a thing so well known, as I
$I have already many offerers for itt. So as, dear

<p. 77

$I Madam, the favor you have so long binne pleased
$I to doe me, I trust now very shortly to answer with
$I a just account and payment of your owne, and
$I will all my lyfe remember with dewe thankefullnes,
$I and requite by the best means I can, having been
$I donne me in such a fashion as I owne not the
$I like to any other, which is unfainedly acknow_ledged
$I by    Your greatly loveing faithfull freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.

$I Harington House, this 20th Febmary [1620-1].
$I Sweet Madam, co(ende me affectionatly to
$I Mr Bacon, and blesse your sonne Fred, in my
$I name, as I beseech God to doe all yours.
$I The worthy Lady Cornewallis, my noble freind.
