$I Mary Queen-Dowager of France to Wolsey. 
$I A.D. 1515.
$I My very good lord,
$I   In my most hearty manner I recommend me
$I unto you, letting you the same to understand that
$I my lord of Suffolk hath sent me your letters which
$I lately he received by Cooke, by which I perceive
$I the faithful good mind which you do bear unto us
$I both, and how that you be determined not to leave
$I us in our extreme trouble; for the which your most
$I fast (faithful) and loving dealing I most entirely
$I thank you, requiring you to continue towards us as
$I you have been which shall never be forgotten in
$I any of our behalfs, but to the uttermost of our
$I power we shall be always ready to shew [you all]
$I faithfull kindness; [as knowe]th our Lord, who [send
$I you long] life. Written [this ... day o]f M[arc]h.
$I   My lord, I require you that I may have so com_fortable
$I letters from the king my brother and from
$I you, for I trow there was never woman that had
$I more need.
$I                        By your loving friend,
$I                                MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE.
$I To my lord of York.
