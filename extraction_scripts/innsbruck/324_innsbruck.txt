$I DEAR CORNWALLEIS,
$I I HAVE written as effectually as I could to my
$I Lo. Chamberlain, who I thinke, if it be in his
$I power, will do what you desier. What the King's
$I resolucion is yett for his owne and his father's
$I servants, he hath not declared farder then the
$I whight staves, which are to remaine as they wear;
$I but for the greene cloth, and other inferior officers
$I both of the household and chamber, itt is thought
$I he will imploye his owne and dismisse his father's,
$I because he hath caused the latter to be all re_moved
$I to Denmarke House to attende the body,
$I and lodged the former about himselfe att White_halle:
$I and, for aught any body yett can discover,
$I he makes his owne determinacions, and is very stiff
$I in them; having already changed the whole face of
$I the court very near to the same forme itt had in
$I Queene Elizabeth's tyme, suffering nonne but
$I the counsell and his bedchamber to come further than
$I the privie chamber, whear he continually abides;
$I nor the councell to go furder than the privie gal_lerie,
$I and causes itt to be strictly kept likewise.
$I Into the presence no more are admitted than his
$I owne servants and gentlemen of quality. Of his
$I bedchamber he hath sworn nonne more than he had

<p. 126

$I before but the Duke of Buckingham, whom he
$I uses very well; but, it is hoped, will be governed
$I by no man, nor will he admitt any of the rest as is
$I thought. After the funerall itt is expected that he
$I will make som alteracions among the great officers,
$I and, the co(on voice is, change my Lord Chamber_lain's
$I staffe into that I shall never but with sorrow
$I see in other hand than that that held itt last, and
$I bestow his upon his brother. Yett so far he hath
$I not yett declared himself; but, if this be, I have
$I taken order that, if any power remaine in the
$I Chamberlaine for the gentlemen ushers' places,
$I whethersoever of them hold that staffe, itt shall be
$I alike for your request; and this I did because I
$I think the chamber will not be settled till the prin_cipal
$I officer be so. The King is pleased to use
$I my Lord Chamberlain that is as graciously as any
$I man; which gives many much confidence, seeing
$I the King so well inclined to favour honest men
$I which he is known to be, and one that will never
$I abuse his trust. Besides, (which, indeed, is the
$I chiefe,) he manifests much care of God's servise,
$I and never failes, morning and evening, coming to
$I prayers to the little closett, nor being an attentive
$I hearer att sermons; so as ther is all good signs
$I that God hath set him over this kingdom for a
$I blessing. This, I know, you will be glad to hear
$I from one you believe would wright no untruth to
$I you, and that hath made me (though I am not

<p. 127

$I much disposed to wright newse) sett down this
$I much. To which I will adde, that our destined
$I Queene is with all possible speede expected hear,
$I for whos coming the coronacion will be stayed,
$I that that, and her mariadge and entrie, may be all
$I but one charge: but the first mariadge in France
$I will be instantly, tbe King having sent his procsey
$I to the King of France, that either his brother or
$I the Duke of Chevreux (which is Prince Joinville
$I that was here) may dispach that, so as the next
$I month she is expected; all else being fully con_cluded,
$I and they in France hastening the espous_als.
$I I am very glad to hear Mr Bacon hath re_covered
$I so good health, whos welcom shall ever
$I be such whear I am as I owe to his meritt and
$I you; whos labor I do not pittie so much but
$I that I wish you would beare him companie to this
$I solitarie place, whear I do not desier to see many
$I now living, but yourselfe very much. I writt to
$I my Lord Chamberlaine to lett John Fenne know
$I his answer, because he came not back hither; and,
$I had I binne sure when I should have seene him,
$I I would rather have spoken than writt, though
$I I know in effect it will be all one, for he knows
$I by my lines as well as he could have done by
$I speach that I as earnestly affect the successe of
$I my recomendacion as I can doe any thing in his
$I power to doe; and I was so loth Mr Glover should
$I have any thing to impute to my least delay, as I

<p. 128

$I writt so late the last night to my Lord Chamber_lain,
$I and dispached John Fenne, as I could not
$I send this from hence with him, who went earlier
$I than I was awake this morning, but make haste
$I itt may overtake him att London. The lying
$I Papists cannot be content to want my Lord
$I Stuartt in the beadrole of those they wold have
$I thought for their glorie; but whosoever knew him
$I living, I hope, will reseave no such false opinion
$I now he is dead, who, eaven after he was speech_less,
$I gave evident demonstracion (being asked by
$I his chaplain) that he believed to be saved by the
$I meritts of Christ: yett, by the follie or villeinie of
$I a ficisian wayted on him (who was Popish), have
$I they got some colour to invent this slander, which
$I I trust will be cleared to all the world, as it is
$I clear in itselfe to those friends from whom he had
$I not a reserved thought, and that knew how far
$I both in sound judgment as well as practise he
$I was from approving any point of their doctrine
$I disagreeing with the creed we profess. I pray
$I God they knew him not so well to be the boldest
$I opposer of their ends as they used means for the
$I shortening of his noble dayes, which that they

<p. 129

$I wear unnaturally cutte off ther are strong suspi_cions
$I in the most; because being att first, by the
$I testimonie of all the surgeons phisicians and his
$I owne servants, as fayer a corse as ever their eyes
$I beheld, in the space of three owres his hoole
$I body, head, and every part swelled so strangely
$I and gangrened so generally as it astonished them
$I all; though the phisicians affirme to have seene
$I the like in pestilential fevers, when the spots
$I break not out afore death, and impute part of the
$I cause to the expedient of chafing his body, att
$I least for the space of an hour before he departed,
$I with hotte cloths, and keeping itt to close in the
$I bed after. God only knows the truth, who, if he
$I had any wrong, I trust will in his justice declare
$I it. It is true that, when he was opened in his
$I stomack and head, there appeared nothing to con_firm
$I this jealosie, which makes the phisicians con_fident
$I it could be no poison they are in these parts
$I acquainted with; yett both myselfe and many
$I other of his friends rest not clear of doubt, though,
$I but upon some farder evidence, it is not to be
$I stirred in; but if ever the least light can be gotten,
$I the feare of all mortal men should not hinder our
$I just prosecucion of so abominable a fact: which
$I yett, if it wear so, hastened our losse but a little;
$I for all his vital parts wear so decayed, as, by the
$I judgment of the doctors, he could hardly have lived
$I out a year, which nobody that looked on him could

<p. 130

$I have suspected; yett he himselfe told me this last
$I winter that he found such an inward decaye in him_selfe
$I as he knew he should live but awhile; but,
$I God knows, I conceived it to be but a melancholy
$I aprehension, seeing his health better to my think_ing
$I than it had beene a year or two before, for his
$I spleene seemed to trouble him lesse. But now I
$I have many reasons to assure myself he expected
$I not to live out this year, though he was sparingest
$I to utter that to those he knew loved him best for
$I grieving them; yett now I call to mind many
$I speeches of his I heeded not when they wear
$I spoken, might have made me take more hold what
$I his opinion was of his short continuance on earth,
$I where he hath not left such another; nor any
$I creature so great a loser as I in the death of a
$I friend, whom, if it had pleased God to have longer
$I spared us, would at this tyme both to the publick
$I and his private friends have binne that wee must
$I not look to see any other. But God saw us not
$I worthy of such a blessing, whos will, as itt is ever
$I best, whatsoever itt apear to oure sense, so must
$I wee submitt ourselves to itt in all things, though
$I it is the hardliest practised lesson of all we learne
$I in religion. My thoughts are, and ever will be,
$I full of his memorie, which makes me tedious when
$I any thing draws me into discourse of him; yett
$I will I not excuse this temper, because it is a duty
$I I owe him in this detracting tyme, when those

<p. 131

$I that durst not have breathed amis on his leaste
$I action while he lived will now ventur as much
$I as in them lies to slubber his fame, when they
$I shall thinke themselves out of the hearing of
$I those would make them keepe in their venom, or
$I make them smart for uttering it at the least.
$I And now I have donne this, it is tyme I ende,
$I whos love and respect to you shall be endless, in
$I which, to my sorrow, you cannot have so much
$I advantage as I have satisfaction to know myselfe
$I for your most affectionate and faithful, though
$I most unfortunate friend, L. BEDFORDE.

$I P. S. Dear Madam, co(ende me affectionately
$I to Mr Bacon, whom if you will bring hither this
$I springe, I hope you would both find good by
$I our ayr, which hitherto hath held free from infection; 
$I and should be glad to see any of yours, too, with
$I you
$I More Lodge, this 12th of April [1625].
