$I Hagh De: 21. (1651).
$I M=r= Secretarie, I haue receaued yours of the 18 of this
$I month. I long to heare my sweet Nephue is at Bruxelles.
$I My Neece has sent Nick: Armourer to meet him there.
$I I haue written to him by him, if the King woulde permitt
$I him to take this place and Teiling in his way from Bruxelles
$I he woulde make his Sister and me verie glade: he need
$I not make such hast to see him, it is but the other day since

<p. 209

$I he was with him, but it is much longer since wee saw him,
$I and I ame sure our hoghen Moghens will take no notice of
$I it if they be not asked the question as they were for the
$I King's comming to Breda. To be with his Sister some
$I time can doe him no harme. I haue taken the boldness to
$I write the same by my Lo: Gerard to the King, who I be_leeue
$I will be with you as soon as this letter, for he went
$I from hence vpon Saterday last. We heere nothing of the
$I rebells fleet heerabouts, but they say that Blag is to ioine
$I with the Spanish fleet against the Duke of Guise. The
$I French Ambassadour beleeues the treatie with Cromwell
$I as good as broken; he is much ioyed that the meeting
$I betwixt the Queene of Sueden and P. of Condé was
$I  to neither of their content, for he desired to be received
$I as the Queen received the Archduke, which she
$I refused, saying she had done too much in that and would

<p. 210

$I doe so no more, yet he came to see her brusguement a
$I l'improuist, and did nothing but railler her in his talke,
$I which putt her so out as she said almost not one word.
$I This was in the morning; after dinner she sent to know
$I if he would see the play at night, he said he would obey
$I her, but desired to know whither he shoulde come knowe
$I or as vnknowen, for if he came as Prince of Condé he looked
$I to haue a chaise a bras as the Archduc had—she saide he had
$I better come unknowen, so he came, and she stood all the
$I play, railling with Mon=r= Quito the Princes favourit. the next
$I day the P. went to Bruxelles, and neither of them well satis_fied
$I with the other. My La: Swann will be heere within a
$I few days, by her I shall know more of this: I haue heard
$I the reason of S=r= Henry de Vics iourney to Coloign: since
$I it is a doting time for the kings oulde Ministers of State, I
$I thanke God your wife is yet aliue, for feare you should fall
$I in loue againe. I pray lett me know when that wedding
$I will be, for I (will) send you a letter to reverent Dick to
$I bespeak him for brideman. I thank you for your congra_tulation
$I of Apollos returne, you know how great a favorit
$I he is to
$I Your most affectionat frend.
$I I pray tell my Ladie Hide I ame verie glade she is so well
$I come to Coloigne.
$I "For M=r= Secretarie."
$I 11/21 Dec: 1654.    R. 14/24.  The Qu: of Bohemia co=g= the Pr. of
$I Condé ond the Qu: of Sweedes being unsatisfied w=h= each other.
