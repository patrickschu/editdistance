$I 9th of October, 1618.
$I Sir,
$I    I take presumption, upon the assured promise of your love, to
$I write unto you herein a few private lines about myself; whereof the
$I scope is this, to beseech you that, as you have obtained leave for my
$I return home the next spring, to the comfortable sight of my gracious
$I master, so you will be pleased likewise to deal with his Majesty
$I in my behalf, that none may be appointed to succeed me here till
$I my arrival; because, when I have settled some of my peculiar

<p. 160

$I occasions, I shall rather wish to come hither back again, than to
$I be onerous to his Majesty at home; for without his bounty I cannot
$I live. In the meanwhile, my Italian ssecretary, Gregorio de' Monti
$I (who supplied the place all the while that Sir Dudley Carleton was
$I at Turino, and afterwards till my coming), will discharge it with
$I fidelity and discretion; being a person of much sufficiency, and of
$I twelve years' approvement in the King's service. This is my most
$I humble and hearty request unto you, about which I have by letter
$I prayed Mr. Bargrave to intercede with you for me. But having not
$I heard from him, I thought fit provisionally to move it by mine own
$I pen; having with no man else living communicated these thoughts,
$I about which I shall languish to receive a line or two from you.
$I And so, again,
$I                             Sir, I am yours,
$I                                     HENRY WOTTON.
