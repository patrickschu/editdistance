$I 5 January 1585.
$I Mr. Broughton, I forgot in my l'res to write for Mr. Aldersey's
$I bills to be sent over in hast by Merik. I pray you as ever you do
$I any thing for me dispatch him wth all speede; for els I shalbe dryven
$I to buy some of those thinges here and take up the mony upon
$I interest. The plate, especially, both dyshes & the other, must be
$I sent out of hand. If you have that care wch I assure my self you
$I will, my man may returne wthin a weeke after he cometh to London.
$I Thus, in hast, I end; referring what I have forgotten to write to
$I his message.    Leyden this vth of January, 1585.
$I Yours assured
$I (Signed) R. ESSEX.
