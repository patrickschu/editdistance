$I                                  Easthamstead
$I                                  26 August [1523]
$I   Hit may lyke your good Grace to be aduertised, that
$I the King[is] Highnes yisterday received a lettre from his Vicead_mira[ll],
$I dated on the see the xiiiith day of August; which lettre
$I your G[race] shall receive with these presentis.
$I   And forasmych as the val[iaunt] acquitaill of Mr. Fittzwilliam
$I and his cumpany singularly well conte[nteth] the Kingis Highnes,
$I as a thing mich redounding to thonor of h[is] Grace and his
$I realme, with high reproch and rebuke of his enem[yes] he re_quireth
$I your Grace therfore, that as well his Viceadm[irall], as
$I other gentilmen of his cumpany, such as your grace shall thi[nk]
$I convenient, may haue sent vn to theym lettres of thank[is], by
$I which they may to theyre cumfort and ferther corage vnderstand
$I how acceptable theire good service is vn to h[is] Highnes.
$I   Ferthermore as towching the twoo shippis which your Grace hath
$I devised to be sent vn to Sir Anthony Pointtz, albe[it] that
$I Mr Viceadmirall, as your Grace may perceive by his lettre, moveth
$I iii thingis which he thinketh wolde [be] considered therin, yit
$I sith your Grace hath had a politique foresight to the provision of
$I the vitail, which is the grettest thing that his Grace regardeth, his
$I pleasure is according to your moost prudent advice that for to
$I put the mater in the more surtie, the said twoo sh[ip]pis shall in
$I eny wise goo forth and that they shall there continue till halfe
$I the moneth of Septembre be passed, after which tyme his Grace
$I thinketh hit good that Sir Anthony Pointtz and his cumpany,
$I shold be discharged, ffor after that tyme his Grace beleveth that
$I the Duke of Albany either shall not goo in to Scotland, or ellis
$I shall goo to late to do either them good or vs hurt, and therfore

<p. 276

$I hit semeth to his Grace good that he shold after the myddis of this
$I next moneth discharge hym selfe of that coste.
$I   In the mean while his Highnes requireth your Grace that those
$I shippis may be so spedily and sufficiently vitailled for the hole
$I tyme of theyre abode vppon theyre entreprise there, as he dowteth
$I not but your Grace hath and will provide therfore, that no lacke
$I of vitaile hyndre or empech theire purpose.
$I   Hit may ferther lyke your good Grace to vnderstand that the
$I Kingis Grace mych alloweth your prudent answere made vn to
$I th'Emperors Embassiator vppon the saufconduicte. For his Grace
$I thinketh it a great hinderaunce to the co[m]en affeires that th'Em_peror
$I shold graunt eny such saufconduicte, wherby there shold be
$I eny mutuall entrecors bitwen his subgiettis and theyre comen
$I enemyes, and the commoditees of Fraunce having vent and vtter_aunce,
$I thenemy therby the bettre furnyshed of mony, shold be
$I the more able  the lenger to mayntayn the warre. And so shall
$I hit be the lenger ere he shall incline to eny resonable conditions
$I of peace. Wherfore his Grace for his part according to your Gracis
$I politique advice is as yit in mynd neither to ratifie that saufcon_duicte,
$I nor to graunt eny lyke, and is glad that your Grace so
$I shewed vn to th'Emperors embassiator.
$I   Hit may ferther lyke your good Grace to be aduertised that one
$I Thomas Murner, a Frere of Saynt Francisce o[rder], which wrote
$I a boke agaynst Luther in defence of the Kingis boke, was owte
$I of Almaigne sent in to England by the meane of a simple person,

<p. 277

$I an Almaigne namyng hym selfe seruant un to the Kingis Grace
$I and affermyng vn to murner that the King had gevyn hym in
$I charge to desire Murner to cum over to hym into En[gland], and
$I by thoccasion therof, he is cummen over and hath n[ow] bene here
$I a good while. Wherfore the Kingis Grace pitiyng that he was so
$I deceived and having tendre respecte to the good zele that he
$I bereth toward the Feith and his good hart and mynd toward his
$I Highne[s], requyreth your Grace that it may lyke you to caus[e]
$I hym haue in reward one hundred pownde, a[nd] that he may
$I retourne home wher his presence is ve[ry] necessary, ffor he is
$I one of the chiefe stays agaynst t[he] faction of Luther in that
$I parties, agaynst whom he hath wrytten many bokis in the Al_mayng
$I tong and now sith his cummyng hither he hath translated
$I in to Latyn the boke that he byfore made in Almaigne in defence
$I of the Kingis boke. He is Doctor of Divinite and of bothe Lawis
$I and a man for wryting and preching of great estimation in his
$I cuntre.
$I   Hit may lyke your Grace ferther to wite that the same simple
$I person which caused Murner to cum in to Englan[d] is now cum_men
$I to the Cort and hath brought with hym a barons son of
$I Almaygne, to whom he hath also persua[ded] that the Kingis
$I Grace wold be glad to haue hym in his service. He hath also
$I brought lettres from Duke Ferdinand vn to the Kingis Grace,
$I which lettres I send vn to your Grace, wherin he desireth the
$I Kingis Highnes to take in to his service and to reteyne with some
$I convenient yerely pention Ducem Mechelburgensem, of which
$I request the Kingis Grace greatly merveileth and veryly thinketh
$I that this simple felow which brought the lettres, lykewise as he
$I caused Murner to cum hither and persuaded the barons sone that
$I the King wold be glad to haue his service, so hath, by some simple
$I ways brought the Duke of Mechelborough in the mynd that the
$I Kingis Grace wold at the comtemplatio[ne] of Duke Ferdinandis
$I lettres be content to reteign the Du[ke] of Mechelborough with a
$I verly pention. The felow hath brou[ght] also fro the Duke of
$I Mechelborough lettres of credence written in the Duche tong.
$I He bare hym selfe in Alma[ygne] for the Kingis seruant and
$I bosted that he had a yerely pent[ion] of his Grace of fiftie markis
$I and that the King had sent h[ym] thither to take vpp seruantz for

<p. 278

$I hym. And now he saith he is servaunt vn to th'Emperors Mageste
$I and is going in to Spaigne with lettres to hym and in dede he
$I hath diverse lettres to his Magestie, and so was it easie f[or] hym
$I to gete, if he entend to deceive and mocke, as t[he] Kingis Grace
$I thinketh that he doth. For his Grace neve[r] saw hym byfore, but
$I he vnderstandeth now that byfo[re] this tym he was in England
$I whan th'Emperor was h[ere] and slew a man and escaped his way.
$I Wherfor h[is] Grace requyreth yours to geve hym your prudent
$I advic[e] as well in a convenient answere to be made both to D[uke]
$I Ferdinand and the Duke of Mechelborough as also in wh[at]
$I wise hit shalbe convenient to ordre this simple fellow, that so hath
$I deceived menne in the Kingis name.
$I   Ferthermore hit may lyke your good Grace to vnderstand that
$I at the contemplation of your Gracis lettres, the Kingis Highnes is
$I graciously content that byside the c li for my fe, for thoffice of the
$I Speker of his Parleament, to be taken at the receipte of his Ex_chequer,
$I I shall haue one other hundred poundis owt of his cofres,
$I by thandis of the Tresorer of his Chambre, wherfor in moost
$I humble wise I besech your good Grace that as your graciouse
$I favor hath obteigned hit for me so it may lyke the same to write
$I to Mr. Wiatt that he may deliver hit to such as I shall send for
$I hit, wherby I and all myne, as the manyfold goodnes of your
$I Grace hath all redy bound vs, shalbe dayly more and more boun_den
$I to pray for your Grace, whom our Lord longe preserve in
$I honour and helth. At Esthamstede the xxvith day of August.
$I     Your humble orator and moost bounden beedman
$I                             Thomas More.
$I   To my Lord Legatis good Grace,
