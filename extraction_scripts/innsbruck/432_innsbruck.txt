$I To Mr. Bohun.
$I Sayes-Court, 29 Jan. 3672.
$I S=r=,
$I If a friend be of infinite value living, how much
$I cause have wee to lament him dead ! Such a friend
$I was S=r= Sam. Tuke, who retired out of this life on
$I St.Paul's day [25 Jan.] at midnight, and has changed
$I the scene to him and us, and left occasion to all
$I that knew him to bewayle the losse.You need not
$I to be made sensible by a character of a person you
$I knew so well, and you can enumerate virtues enough
$I to lament and shed some teares justly; therefore
$I spare me the sorrow of repeating what effect it has
$I wrought on such a minde as mine, who think no
$I missfortune worth regretting besides the losse of
$I those I love. Do not blame me if I beleeve it all_most
$I impossible to meet with a person so worthy in

<p. 437

$I himselfe, and so disposed to  esteeme me againe;
$I and yet that is not the chiefest cause of my afflic_tion.
$I I might wave much of my owne interest, had
$I I not so  many partners that will suffer equally.
$I These are the trialls which make Christian philo_sophy
$I usef'ull, not only by a resignation to the Di_vine
$I decree, but by that hope which encourages us
$I to expeet a more lasting happinesse then any this
$I world can give, without which wee were extreamly
$I wretched, since no felicity here has any duration.
$I The greatest conquerors themselves are subject to
$I this unsteady state of humane nature, therefore well
$I may I submitt, whose concerns are triviall in respect
$I of others. Yet this I conclude, that wee dye by de_grees
$I when our friends go before us. But whilst I
$I discuss this with you, I should consider what effects
$I melancholy reflections may have on a spleen_etic
$I person, one who needes not cherish that tem_per.
$I I will only add that I am now able to quitt
$I my chamber, which is more then I could do these
$I 14 dayes, and that I am, Sir,
$I Your servant, M. Evelyn.
