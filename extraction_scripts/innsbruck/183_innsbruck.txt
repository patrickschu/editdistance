$I My Lorde havinge reseuede your Lordeships letters,
$I I parceve in them your goodwil towards me bicause
$I you declare to me plainlie your mynde in this thinge;
$I and againe for that you wolde not wische that I shulde
$I do any thinge that shulde not seme good unto the
$I Counsel, for the wiche thinge I give you most hartie
$I thankes.    And wheras I do understande that you do
$I take in ivel parte the letters that I did write unto your
$I Lordeshipe, I am verye sorie that you shulde take them
$I so for my mynde was to declare unto you plainlie as I
$I thogth in that thinge, wiche I did also the more will_ingelye
$I bicause (as I write to you) you desired me to
$I be plaine with you in al thinges.   And as concerninge
$I that pointe that you write that I seme to stande in my
$I none witte in beinge so wel assured of my none selfe,
$I I did assure me of my selfe nomore than I trust the
$I trueth shal trie; and to say that wiche I knewe of my
$I selfe I did not thinke shulde have displeased the Coun_sel
$I or your Grace.   And surelye the cause whie that
$I I was sorye that ther shulde be anye suche aboute me,
$I was bicause that I thogth the people wil say that I de_served
$I thought my lewde demenure to have such a
$I one, and not that I mislike any thinge that your Lorde_shipe
$I or the Counsel shal thinke good, for I knowe
$I that you and the Counsel ar charged with me; or that
$I I tak upon me to rule my selfe, for I knowe the ar
$I most disceved that trusteth most in themselves, wher_fore
$I I trust you shal never finde that faute in me, to

<p. 157

$I the wiche thinge I do not se that your Grace has made
$I anye directe answere at this time, and seinge the make
$I so ivel reportes alreadie, shalbe but a increasinge of
$I ther ivel tonges. Howbeit you did write that if I wolde
$I bringe forthe anye that had reported it, You and the
$I Counsel wolde se it redreste, wiche thinge thogth I
$I can easelye do it, I wolde be lothe to do it for bicause
$I it is my none cause; and, againe, that shulde be but a
$I bridinge of a ivel name of me that am glade to ponesse
$I them, and so get the ivel wil of the people, wiche thinge
$I I wolde be lothe to have. But if it mougth so seme
$I good unto your Lordeshipe and the reste of the Coun_sel
$I to sende forthe a proclamation in to the countries
$I that the refraine ther tonges, declaringe how the tales
$I be but lies, it shulde make bothe the people thinke that
$I You and the Counsel have great regarde that no suche
$I rumors shulde be spreade of anye of the Kinges Majes_ties
$I Sisters, as I am, thougth vnwordie, and also I
$I shulde thinke myselfe to receve suche frendeshipe at
$I your handes as you have promised me, althogth your
$I Lordeship hathe shewed me greate alreadie. Howbeit
$I I am aschamed to aske it anye more, bicause I se you
$I ar not so wel minded therunto. And as concerninge
$I that you saye that I give folkes occasion to thinke in
$I refusinge the good to vpholde the ivel, I am not of so
$I simple understandinge, nor I wolde that your Grace
$I shulde have so ivel a opinion of me that I have so litel

<p. 158

$I respecte to my none honestie that I wolde mainteine
$I it if I had souficiente promis of the same, and so your
$I Grace shall prove me when it comes to the point, And
$I thus I bid you farewel, desiringe God alwais to assiste
$I you in al your affaires. Writen in hast. Frome Hat_felde
$I this 21 of Februarye.
$I Your assured frende to my litel
$I power
$I ELIZABETH.
$I To my verey good Lorde my Lorde Protector.
