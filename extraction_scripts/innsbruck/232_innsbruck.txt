<Sir Francis Drake to Walsyngham (1588a),
<The Defeat of the Spanish Armada, ed. Laughton, vol. II, pp. 97-100.

$I   Most Honourable:  The army of Spain I think
$I certainly to be put either with Norway or Denmark.
$I There are divers causes which moveth me so to
$I think. The first, we understand by divers prisoners
$I which we have taken, that generally, through all
$I their whole fleet, there was no one ship free of sick
$I people. Secondly, their ships, masts, sails and
$I ropes were very much decayed and spoiled by our

<p. 98

$I great shot. Thirdly, at Calais, by fire, we forced
$I them to cut many of their cables, whereby they lost
$I many of their anchors, which of necessity they must
$I seek to supply. Further, if they had had none of
$I these former great causes of distress, yet the winds
$I and storm, with the wind westerly, as it was, hath
$I forced them thither. And I assure myself that
$I whensoever her Majesty shall hear of their arrival
$I in any of these coasts, that her Highness shall be
$I advertised both of their great distress and of no
$I small loss amongst them; for I assure your Honour,
$I her Majesty's good ships felt much of that storm,
$I and lost many of their boats and pinnaces, with
$I some anchors and cables; yet were we fair by our
$I own shore and the wind right off the land.
$I   Some amongst us will not let to say that they
$I are in Scotland. I cannot think so, for that we had
$I no wind whereby they were able to recover any
$I place of the mainland of Scotland; without it were
$I some of the out isles, which are no meet places to
$I relieve their so many great wants. Norway, or the
$I out isles of Scotland, can relieve them but with
$I water and a few cows, or bad beef, and some small
$I quantity of goats and hens, which is to them as
$I nothing. And yet these bad reliefs are to be had
$I but in few places, and their roads dangerous.
$I   The only thing which is to be looked for is, that
$I if they should go to the King of Denmark, and
$I there have his friendship and help for all their re_liefs,
$I none can better help their wants in all these
$I parts than he; for that he is a Prince of great
$I shipping, and can best supply his wants which now
$I the Duke of Medina the Sidonia standeth in need
$I of, as great anchors, cables, masts, ropes and victuals;
$I and what the King of Spain's hot crowns will do in

<p. 99

$I cold countries for mariners and men, I leave to your
$I good Lordship, which can best judge thereof.
$I   We left a pinnace of her Majesty's, the Advice,
$I and a fine caravel of my own to attend the fleet of
$I Spain, when we left them; but what is become of
$I them [in] that great storm, or whether they may be
$I stayed in any other country, as they may, I know
$I not. My poor opinion is, that it were most meet to
$I send a good ship and some fine bark, with some
$I very sufficient person, to deal effectually from her
$I Majesty with the King of Denmark, as he shall find
$I the cause to require; and to send the true report
$I back with all speed possible, that they may be the
$I better prevented; for no doubt but that which they
$I are able to do they will presently put it in execution.
$I The winter will overtake them else in those parts.
$I If they stay in the sound this winter, I hope many
$I of the Spaniards will seek Spain by land.
$I   The Prince of Parma, I take him to be as a bear
$I robbed of her whelps; and no doubt but, being so
$I great a soldier as he is, that he will presently, if he
$I may, undertake some great matter; for his rest will
$I stand now thereupon. It is for certain that the
$I Duke of sidonia standeth somewhat jealous of him,
$I and the Spaniards begin to hate him, their honour
$I being touched so near; many of their lives spentI
$I assure your Honour not so little as five thousand
$I men less than when first we saw them near Ply_mouth
$I divers of their ships sunk and taken; and
$I they have nothing to say for themselves in excuse,
$I but that they came to the place appointed, which
$I was at Calais, and there stayed the Duke of Parma's
$I coming above 24 hours, yea, and until they were
$I fired thence.
$I   So this is my poor conclusion. If we may re_cover
$I near Dunkirk this night or to-morrow morn_ing,

<p. 100

$I so as their power may see us returned from the
$I chase, and ready to encounter them if they once
$I sally, that the next news you shall hear will be the
$I one to mutiny against the other; which when that
$I shall come to pass, or whether they mutiny or no,
$I let us all, with one consent, both high and low,
$I magnify and praise our most gracious and merciful
$I God for his infinite and unspeakable goodness to_wards
$I us; which I protest to your good Lordships
$I that my belief is that our most gracious Sovereign,
$I her poor subjects, and the Church of God hath
$I opened the heavens in divers places, and pierced
$I the ears of our most merciful father, unto whom, in
$I Christ Jesu, be all honour and glory. so be it;
$I Amen, Amen.
$I   Written with much haste, for that we are ready
$I to set sail to prevent the Duke of Parma this
$I southerly wind, if it please God; for truly my poor
$I opinion is that we should have a great eye unto him.
$I From her Majesty's very good ship the Revenge,
$I this 10th of August, 1588.
$I        Your Honour's faithfully to be
$I                        commanded always,
$I                                         FRA. DRAKE.
$I   For that we were very near to set sail, I most
$I humbly beseech your Honour to pardon my pen, for
$I that I am forced to write the very copy of that letter
$I which I have sent to my Lord Chancellor. Since
$I the writing hereof, I have spoken with an English_man
$I which came from Dunkirk yesterday, who saith
$I upon his life there is no fear of the fleet. Yet would
$I I willingly see it.    Your Honour's ever,
$I                                      FRA. DRAKE.
