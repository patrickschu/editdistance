$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I I AM most hartely sorry to heare you are soe ill
$I as your letter tells me, which I reseaved with the

<p. 227

$I dainty pott of jely, for which, as for the rest of
$I your favors, I can only retorne thankes and con_tinue
$I constantly yours. I sent a letter to you last
$I weeke, fastened to a little box, which I make ques_tion
$I whether you reseaved or noe, becaus I heard
$I nothing. Ther was some busines concerning my
$I Lady Barrington, who will be in towne by the time
$I this letter come to you; and I know not whether
$I your resolution hould conserning the match she
$I propounded or noe, and I am suer she will aske
$I me whether she shall prosede in it, which I will
$I say nothing to till I hear from you. I heare of
$I a very prety gentillwoman that hath six hundred
$I pounds a year, and her father and mother dead;
$I but ther is eighteen hundred pounds to be paid to
$I her grandmother for her wardship, some of it. If
$I you like of this, I think ther might be meanes found
$I to propound it. Mr Randolph went to see her,
$I and co(ends her for very hansome, and sixteen
$I years ould. My mother is very ill with the gout,
$I I am afraid I shall not enjoy her long. Thus,
$I with my faithful love recommended to you, I rest,
$I Your Ladyship's humble servt,
$I          DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
$I [1629-30.]
$I To my most honored frend the Lady Bacon, Culford.
