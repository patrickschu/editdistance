$I MY MOST HONORED LADY AND DEAREST FREND,
$I I RETORNE you humble thankes for your coach,
$I which brought us well to Coulchester, where I met
$I Mr Randolph with another, but not one that will
$I bring us to London before Saturday night, I per_seave
$I nothing by him that should cause my stay in
$I London longer then to see my mother and doe my
$I duty to her, for she finds good frends to helpe her
$I to money out of the Exchequer, and that is all she
$I is like to expect, he tells me; yet I am resolved
$I to trie what may be done for her, and then make
$I hast to kiss your hands at Brome again, which I
$I hope to doe within a fortnight or three weekes.

$I My father, to my great joye, made his last actions
$I sutable to his former, which was, he did his inde_vor
$I to sell his offis, which was made over to Mr
$I Randolph before, and came so neer it as the man
$I was in the howse with money to paie for it, when
$I at the instant he failed of words and breath, soe
$I nothing was done. If Mr Randolph had not gone
$I as he did, it seemes he had lost his offis; for my
$I Lord Carlisle co(ended one to the King, which
$I he apointed to posses my father's plase, Mr Ran_dolph
$I being such a stranger as I think they knew
$I not what right he had to it; but now they are per_swaded
$I to let the man paie for it and be his part_ner,
$I and reseave half the benefit, which he might
$I have possesed alone had he not neglected it, as he
$I doth all things; but he seemes glad ther is one to
$I do the busines for him, that he may live like a
$I drone as he did.
$I I am your most true harted cosin and humblest
$I servant,    DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
$I [1629.]
