$I The Queen of Bohemia to Mr. Secretary Nicholas.
$I Hagh, Oct. 19. (1654.)
$I Mr. Secretarie, hearing that you may chance to stay all
$I this week at Collein, I send you this inclosed for the King,
$I to giue him humble thankes for his aprobation of Sophies
$I mariage. You will haue vnderstood by Curtius all the
$I newes of Germanie, for his going to waite vpon the King.
$I You will finde by the English prints that they are forbidden
$I to write anie thing of the proceedings of their mock Parlia_ment.
$I I was at Delft to see the wrack that was made by
$I the blowing up of the powder this day seuenight, it is a sad
$I sight, whole streets quite razed; not one stone vpon an_other,
$I it is not yett knowen how manie persons are lost
$I there is scarse anie house in the toune but the tyles are off.
$I â€” (A great blot on the paper.) Apollo with leaping into
$I my lapp has made this blott. Thom. Killegrew is heere,
$I who makes a rare relation of the Queene of Sueden. It is
$I verie colde, which I hope will diminish the plague. I pray
$I be confident that I am euer
$I Your most affectionat frend,
$I Elizabeth.

<p. 205

$I I ame extreme glade to heare that the King is satisfied
$I with Ruperts letter, and that he has answered him so kind_lie.
$I I pray doe poore Curtius all the fauour you can, that
$I he haue something from the King to incourage him the
$I more to serue him.
