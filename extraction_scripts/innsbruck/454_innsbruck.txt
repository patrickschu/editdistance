$I September 16, 1680.
$I D.S.,
$I    My cosen Cradock went suddenly awaye, so that I
$I could not enjoy him at my howse as I intended: present
$I my service unto him & my cosen his wife. I am glad to
$I hear that Sr Arthur Ingraham is so well as to go abroad
$I into the countrey, and also so kind as to remember you
$I with a present of wine, which may do you more service
$I in the winter then in this hott & sickly wether, for 'tis
$I likely to bee of the most sprituous & heady sort. I
$I beleeve Collot is now gone. Mr Feltham told mee hee
$I had butt ill successe in one operation when yourself and
$I Mr. Feltham were present. I am glad you have so good
$I hopes of Mrs Tye: pray remember my service unto her
$I at your opportunity. Shee is of an honest family and
$I generally the Coldhams were good persons, & shee her
$I self a good conditioned woeman. You did well to reade
$I over Bartholinus de prâ€˜gnantium medicina. Hee is a good
$I practicall & theoricall writer, & doubtlesse you may
$I meet with some good observations therin. I have not as
$I yet seen it. You may take good notice of what hee sayth
$I therein, for you cannot chuse but meet with many
$I questions from woemen with child; butt 'tis litle to bee
$I question'd that the booke you read of the projection at
$I Vienna and the historie of it, will find many Readers, for
$I the like hath not been writt where the powder hath been
$I putt to sale, and so the verity thereof been so subject

<p. 183

$I unto triall. Butt when this parcell is spent, a great doubt
$I there wil bee how any more will bee acquired, & 'tis not
$I very likely that there is any true way delivered in the
$I booke to make a newe powder, so that tis probable this
$I parcell will bee soone consumed & many great persons
$I who can bee at the charge will not bee without it. I
$I should bee glad to see the booke & read it, for I doubt
$I it is not at least as yet of common sale. Madame Burwell
$I hath yet some distemper'd nights. I am glad you can
$I please my L.M. of Dorchester, when you go to him, with
$I some dissection or what hee desires. You have surely
$I much obliged him by his last recovory. God blesse my
$I daughter Browne & you all. Tom was ill last weeke, butt
$I upon taking a litle powder of Rhubarb grewe better &
$I now goeth abroad. Wee all send our love & good wishes.
$I                             I rest
$I                                 Y.l.f.
$I                                    T.B.
$I For Dr Edward Browne in Salisbury court these next
$I the golden balls   London
