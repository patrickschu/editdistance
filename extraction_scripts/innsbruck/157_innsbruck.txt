$I   Our Lord blesse you.
$I   My dearely beloved Daughter, I doubt not but by
$I reason of the kinges Councellours resorting hither in
$I this tyme in which the fathers of the Charter house and
$I some others be iudged to death for treason, may hap to
$I put you in some feare [for me], especiallie for that it is
$I not vnlikely but that you haue hard that I also was
$I brought before them, I thought [it] necessarie to adver_tise
$I you, to the end that you should not conceave more
$I hope then the matter giveth, or more greife then the
$I present occasion ministreth. Therefore shall you vnder_stand
$I that on frydaie last, the 30th of Aprill, in the
$I afternoone, maister Lievtenant  shewed me that Maister

<p. 214

$I Secretarie would speake with me. Wherevpon I went
$I out with hym into the gallerye, where his maistership
$I sat with  maister Attourney, * maister Solicitour, [and]
$I diuers others. I was offered to sitt downe with them,
$I but in no wise I would.
$I   Maister Secreatrie told me  that he nothing doubted
$I but that I had  seene the new statutes made the last
$I sitting of the Parliament. I aunswered, yea, verilie
$I howbeit for as much as I, being here, and  not minding
$I to medle with Those matters any more, I thought it
$I litle nede for me to bestow much tyme vpon them.
$I He asked me whether I had red the first statute of the
$I kings being heade of the Church. I aunswered, Yea.
$I Then his maisterhip declared vnto me that sith it
$I was now by act of Parliament ordeined that his Highnes
$I and his heires is, and was, and perpetuallie should be,
$I supreame head in earth of the Church of England,
$I immediatelie vnder Christ, the kings pleasure was that
$I these here of his Counsell assembled should demaund my
$I opinion therein. Whervnto I aunswered that in good
$I faith I had well trusted that his Highnes would never
$I haue commaunded any such question to be asked of me,

<p. 215

$I considering that I ever from the beginning well and trulie
$I declared my minde to his Maiestie, and also vnto your
$I Maistership, both by mouth and writing; and now I
$I haue discharged my mynde [of] all such matters, meaning
$I not hereafter to dispute kinges or Popes titles. I am
$I the kings faithfull subiect, and wilbe, and daylie pray
$I for hym and all his Realme, and otherwise then this I
$I intend not to medle. Whervnto maister Secretarie
$I aunswered that he thought y=t= this manner of aunswere
$I would not satisfie the kings highnes; for y=t= his Grace
$I expected a more full aunswere, and that to the purpose.
$I And he added that the king was a Prince not of rigour
$I but of mercie and pittie, and thoughe he had found
$I obstinacie in any of his Subiectes at some tyme, yet if
$I they submitted themselves, his Grace would shewe
$I mercie. And for you, maister More, I knowe so much
$I that his Grace would be glad to see you take such con_formable
$I waies that you might be abroade againe, with
$I a great creadit and worship as ever you were. Where_vnto
$I I aunswered I would not medle in the world againe,
$I to have all the world given me, as in effect I aunswered
$I before.

<p. 216

$I   "Then was I commaunded to goe forth awhile, and
$I presently called in againe. Then said maister Secretarie
$I vnto me, Though you are a prisoner condemned to
$I perpetuall imprisonment, yet thereby I was not discharged
$I of my alleageance to his Highnes, & wherupon he de_maunded
$I whither I thought his Highnes might not
$I exact a direct aunswere of me, of such thinges as might
$I be demaunded, as of any other, I aunswered that I
$I thought his Highnes might. Then, said he, that like as
$I his Highnes would be gratious to them that he found
$I conformable, so his Grace fullie determined to followe
$I the course of the lawe towardes such as shall showe
$I themselves wilfull and obstinate; & your demeanure
$I in this matter, maister More, hath made many so stife
$I therein as they be. Whervnto I aunswered that I
$I gaue no man occasion, neither by worde nor writing,
$I to hold on the one side or the other. And for conclusion
$I I would goe no furhter, whatsoever paine should me
$I befall. For I am the kinges true faithfull subiect and
$I beadsman. I doe no bodie any harme, I say no harme,
$I I thincke no harme, I wish everie bodie well, I pray for
$I them. And if this be not enoughe to keep me alive, in
$I good faith I desire not to liue. I am at the kinges

<p. 217

$I pleasure. I would to god my death would doe hym
$I good.
$I   Well, maister More, quoth maister Secretarie,
$I report shalbe made to his Highnes, and his gratious
$I pleasure knowne, you shall heare further.
$I   So he bade me farewell. And so to my Chamber by
$I maister Liefteante I was brought againe.
