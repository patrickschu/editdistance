$I I haue received y=r= letter, and request for a supply
$I of mony; but none of those you mention which
$I were bare effects of y=r= duty. If you were so desirous
$I to answer our expectations as you pretend to be,
$I you would give those tutors and overseers you
$I think so exact over you lesse trouble then I feare
$I they have with you. Much is to be wished in yor
$I behalfe: that y=r= temper were humble and tractable,
$I y=r= inclinations virtuous,d and that from choice not
$I compulsion you make an honnest man. Whateuer
$I object of vice comes before you, should haue the
$I same effect in y=r= mind of dislike and aversion that
$I dronkenesse had in the youth of Sparta when their
$I slaves were presented to them in that brutish condi_tion,
$I not only from the deformity of auch a sight,
$I but from a motive beyond theirs, the hope of a
$I future happinesse, which those rigorous heathens
$I in moral virtue had little prospect of, finding no
$I reward for virtue but in virtue itselfe. You are
$I not too young to know that lying, defrauding,

<p. 443

$I swearing, disobedience to parents and persons in
$I authority, are offences  to God and man: that de_bauchery
$I is injurious to growth, health, life, and in_deed
$I to the pleasures of life: therefore now that
$I you are turning from child to man endeavour to
$I follow the best precepts, and chuse such wayes as
$I may render you worthy of praise, and love. You
$I are assured of y=r= Fathers care and my tendernesse:
$I no mark of it shall be wanting at any time to con_firme
$I it to you, with this  reserve only, that you
$I strive to deserve kindnesse by a sincere honest pro_ceeding,
$I and not flatter y=r= selfe that you are good
$I whilst you only appeare to be so.    Fallacies will
$I only passe in schools. When you throughly weigh
$I these considerations, I hope you will apply them to
$I your owne advantage, as well as to our infinite sa_tisfaction.
$I I pray dayly God would  inspire you
$I with his grace, and blesse you.
$I I am,
$I Y=r= louing mother,
$I M. Evelyn.
