$I London, 16th March, 1687[-8].
$I DEAR SIR,
$I    Since my last I have gotten the abridgment, which came
$I to me in quires, bound and gilded as the other was; and accor_ding
$I to your order have placed it in Sir walter's hands to be

<p. 259

$I conveyed to mrs duke. And the other, which remains in
$I marble paper, I shall also send by him to Mr. freke about a
$I fortnight hence, when he designs to go out of town, if I have no
$I other opportunity by a safe hand in the meantime to convey it
$I to him.
$I    I have also gotten you a good beaver hat made by the
$I diameter of the inside of the crown of the band exactly according
$I to the dimension marked by the two black pins in your letter of
$I the ninth instant. A peruke I have also bought for you, pur_suant
$I to your directions in the same letter, as near as possible
$I as I could. And these, together with six flannel-shirts (bought
$I and made up by your very good friend Mrs. R.S.) and a cloak,
$I which in the buying and making up I gave her my best assistance,
$I I have sent hence by your old friend Adrian, who stayed but one
$I day in town, and is this day set out from hence towards you,
$I and it is possible may be with you as soon (or before) this can
$I come to your hands. He promised me to take particular care
$I of them all, and to see them safely delivered to you, which
$I I hope he will do, they being all in my opinion extremely good of
$I the kind, and I believe will give content in the wearing.
$I    By him you will also receive a letter that I had from Mr.
$I Stringer in answer to what by your order I writ to him touching
$I your picture, by which you will find that he is resolved not to
$I part with it. And I would by him also have sent to you a grant
$I of your estate at Beluton and St. Thomas to J. N., as you desire
$I could I have gotten time during his stay here to have done it,
$I but now I think I must take a time by your directions and in
$I your presence to do it, which if God bless my wife with an happy
$I lying-in, and no extraordinary business prevent, my inclinations
$I do very strongly prompt me to. But since there are so many
$I accidents which may contradict my intentions in this par_ticular
$I I dare promise nothing; but trust on Providence to send
$I us a happy meeting, which I earnestly desire and long for. In
$I the meantime give me leave to assure you that I will use all
$I imaginable care and caution to find out the truth of what was
$I done in that affair touching w p and my cousin, that in your
$I last you mentioned to me. And I will also take care to get
$I â€™sop's Fables, in Latin, English and French with cuts, as you
$I have ordered, and will wait your further directions for making
$I the best use of them.

<p. 260

$I    Just now I received the enclosed from my son, with his
$I earnest desires that in my next it might be conveyed to you.
$I It was in the shape of a letter directed to you; but the back-part
$I of it, for the conveniency of postage, I took off, and hope you
$I will pardon both him and me for troubling you with it, since
$I you will there see what good effects the following of your methods
$I in teaching the child to write, as well as all other things, hath
$I already produced. He begins to be sensible of the great kind_ness
$I you have done him, and I hope as he increases in know_ledge
$I he will be no less grateful than him, who by all manner of
$I ties you have obliged to be never other than
$I                Your most affectionate, faithful servant,
$I                         E....
$I    Madam gives her hearty service to you, is very well, but not
$I yet laid, and joins her desires with mine that you will send ...
$I prints of those copies of which you have already given us a
$I sight, the caracter being much better (as I think) than any
$I I can get here, etc.
$I    I have written again to Mr. Elwill, who hath repeated his
$I promises under hand to me, that he will take particular care to
$I send the bags again to Mr. Furley, wherein the provision for the
$I sheep was sent over, etc.
$I [Addr.]: For Mr. John Locke, These.
