$I    My very good Lord:  I now remain aboard the
$I Bear; and as yet the provisions for the ships could
$I not be taken all in by reason of the weather, which
$I hath been so tempestuous as that no boats could lie
$I aboard them to put in the same; yet I hope that
$I within two or three days all things will be in a
$I readiness.
$I   Here is a very sufficient and able company of
$I sailors as ever were seen; and because their long
$I journeys out of all places of this realm, and this bad
$I season, makes them unprovided of apparel and such
$I necessaries, it were good for their relief to pay them
$I one month's wages before hand.
$I   Many great charges extraordinary hath grown
$I this quarter, which I could  hardly have believed
$I unless with mine own eyes and good examination I
$I had seen. Wherefore in respect of those causes, and
$I for the furtherance of service, I am to entreat your
$I good Lordship to give order that the rest of the
$I warrant lately granted for the whole navy may be
$I paid to Mr Hawkyns, and 2.000l. more upon the old
$I warrant of 29.000l. for the furnishing of those extra_ordinary
$I charges, wherein your Lordship shall further
$I a good service.

$I   We have entered into sea victuals this day, being
$I the 22nd of this instant December, and not before,
$I for the preserving of the six weeks' victuals. And
$I Mr. Quarles hath sent down divers supplies more
$I than allowancefor the numbers were great before
$I we entered into the six weeks' victuals. Wherefore
$I I pray your Lordship that he may be paid the  rest
$I of his allowed warrant, and that consideration for the
$I rest which I spake to your Lordship for heretofore.
$I And so I bid your good lordship most heartily fare_well.
$I From aboard the Bear, the 22d of December,
$I 1587.
$I           Your Lordship's most assured
$I                    loving friend to command,
$I                                      C. Howard.
