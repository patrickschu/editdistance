$I DEARE CORNEWALLIS,
$I IF your lines are ever exceedinge wellcome to
$I me, both because they comme from you and that
$I they bringe with them the assurance of the con_tinuance
$I of your affection to me, which I infinitly
$I prise and will never live not to deserve with the
$I best proofes I can ever give you of mine, which
$I I must acknowledge but a dew debt to you, as is
$I the vissit I owe you at your owne house; which
$I that I have not according to my promis performed
$I ther hath binne no fault in my will, nor other
$I hindrance then His that disposeth of His, att His,
$I not our pleasure, and, as I formerly writte to you,
$I made my health such all the last sommer, and till
$I itt was within this very few weakes, as I was forsed
$I to setle hear and breake all my purposes to recover
$I my selfe owt of a very ill state of body; which I
$I thanke God I have now so donne as I hope I shall
$I be as well able to travell againe as ever, and if I be
$I so I will, if beyond my power to helpe I be not
$I againe prevented, see you att Broome before my
$I goeinge into Germany, wheather my duty to my
$I mother and her Highnes will carry me this springe
$I if I be forsed, as I thinke I shall, to use the helpe of
$I the Spaw for the confirmacion of my health and

<p. 41

$I prevention of som infirmities I have of late years
$I been subject to, for which Mayerne counsells me
$I to goe theather, which I shall doe with much the
$I more willingnes that I may wayte by that ocasion
$I on my mother, who crossed the sea theatherward
$I on Thursday last, and I hope landed well that
$I night at Callis, though I have not yett heard so
$I much. I have not forgotten to putte the Queen in
$I mind of her promis to you, but in that as all others
$I she is sloe in performance; I will not be so in
$I soliciting her till you have your desier in that as I
$I wishe itt you in all else with as much unfainednes
$I as I do any good to,
$I Your most affectionat, most faithfull freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.

$I Doe me the favor to comend me affectionatly to
$I Mr Bacon.
$I Bedford Houss, whear I am stayed in expectation of the Queen's
$I daylie remoove to Wight Hall, which hath binne hindred by paine in
$I her foote; this Sunday morninge, in hast [1616].
$I To my dear and worthy freind the La. Cornewallis.
