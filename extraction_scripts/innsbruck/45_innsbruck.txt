$I and it lusteth hym to do soo.
$I And in all other thynges, as to my Lady Pool wyth hom I
$I sojourned, that ye wil be my tendre and gode moder that she 
$I may be payde for all the costes doon to me before my maryage;
$I and to Cristofre Hanson, as ye wrote unto my brother John that
$I it shuld have ben so . And that it plese youre gode moderhode to
