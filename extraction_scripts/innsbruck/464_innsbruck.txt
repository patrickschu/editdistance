$I Dear Sir,
$I    Your kind letter of the 17th has been now a full week in
$I my hands, for which you had immediately received my thanks
$I had I been able to write. But soon after my last of the 16th
$I from Salisbury to you I was taken ill of an ague, with an ill fever
$I that attended it, which so much weakened me that it was not
$I without great difficulty I got hither, but by use of the Cortex
$I Peruv. I thank God I am now able to tell you that I am at
$I present free from both, and do hope shall continue so, but am
$I not in condition to go abroad to dispatch the business I came
$I into the country for, which you may imagine (my circumstances
$I considered) is no small disappointment and trouble to me.
$I    You have exceedingly obliged my gardener by your junkills
$I and the large nasturtium indicum seed you have sent him,
$I which we hear are safely arrived at Topsom by Spicer, and I hope
$I some time the next week to get them safe hither. The lime_tree
$I seeds, and the turnip seeds you mention, will be no less
$I acceptable, when they come; but I hear nothing as yet of their
$I arrival.
$I    I am entirely satisfied in every article of yours and Mr. F.'s
$I accompts, and do not doubt but Mr. Percival will make punctual

<p. 281

$I payment of the bill that is drawn on him for L110 17s 11d.
$I mentioned in your letter. But I have neither strength nor time
$I to thank my good friend Benjamin [Furly] as I ought, either for
$I his great kindness to me whilst I was in Holland, or the extra_ordinary
$I care and trouble he hath taken for me since. And there_fore
$I I beg you to make him sensible of my hearty acknowledg_ments,
$I and earnest hopes, that I may some time or other be
$I happy in an opportunity to serve him. And I heartily thank
$I you for opening the complimentary letter you mention that was
$I directed to me. And I wish you had done the like by the other
$I also, for I cannot guess at the hand by that part of the super_scription
$I you sent me. Therfore, pray open that also, and in
$I your next let me know the contents of it, if material, and by whom
$I it was written. And with mine and madam's true love and
$I service to you and all the good family with you, I subscribe,
$I though perfectly tired, yet,
$I            your most affectionate friend and obliged servant,
$I                              E.... 
{Clarke}

$I September the 30th.
$I    Miss Betty adds her service to you, and all her younger
$I gallants, etc.
