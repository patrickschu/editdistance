$I SIR
$I Although the awnswere I receved from you 
$I two daies since gave mee small incouragement to flat_ter
$I my self that anie importunity I could make should 
$I bee able to appease the scandall you had conceaved to 
$I bee geven you by my unfortunat husband: yet hade 
$I it not pleased God to powre uppon mee one affliction

<p. 57

$I after an other, and to add to the immesurable sor_rowes
$I of my harte so violent a sicknes as I am not able 
$I of my self to stur out of my bed, I had presented unto
$I your vew the image of the importunate Widow men_tioned
$I in the Scriptur, and had never ceased to pester
$I you with my complaines till you had afforded me some
$I  assurance that, whatsoever respects might dehorte you 
$I  from so much as wishinge my husband's good, yet that
$I  an afflicted and wofull lady should not wholly loose her
$I  labor, or return desperate of such comforts at the last
$I  yeare you so honorably ministred unto me in a great
$I affliction though differinge from this in qualitie.     As
$I I receaved then such noble curtesies from you as must
$I never bee forgotten; so bee perswaded, I beseech you,
$I that whatsoever new favor you shall now be pleased 
$I to add to the old, shall so binde mee to reverence of 
$I your vertues as I will resolve to recken my self a bank_erout
$I till I have yeelddid some demonstrative testi_monie
$I of the best thankfullnes that the honestest harte 
$I can expresse for the worthest benefitt. Honorable Sir,
$I I know there bee private causes to discourage mee
$I from movinge you heerin: yet, seeinge the highest 
$I providence hath placed you in a callinge most propper 
$I to bee a mene for my comforte, and that former ex_periance 
$I hath tought me that you are rather inclyned
$I to doe good then to looke allway to private interest, I 
$I beseech you, even for your vertues sake, performe this
$I noble office for mee as to joyne with the rest of your

<p. 58

$I LL=trs= of the Councell in presentinge my humblest theise 
$I tedious blotts from her feeble hand and sad
$I sick harte that is stored with much thankfullnes and 
$I infinite best wishes unto you, who will ever rest 
$I Your most beeholdinge poore
$I distressed frend
$I FRA: Essex.
$I And M=r= Secretary even as you desire of God that 
$I your owne sonne never bee made orphane by the un_timely
$I or unnaturall death of his deere father, vouch_safe
$I a relentinge to the not urginge if you may not to 
$I the hindringe of that fatall warrant for Execution,
$I which if it bee once signed I shall never wish to breath 
$I one howre after.
$I To the right honorable M=r=. Secretary Cecill
