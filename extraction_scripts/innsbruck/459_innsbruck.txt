$I 31st Oct. 1686.
$I Sir,
$I    Though I have taken so much pains in my business,
$I and recovered more of haroll than I expected or I believe I
$I should have done had I been there myself, yet it is to be doubted
$I whether you will permit me to give you thanks. But whatever right
$I you think you have particularly to do me all the kindness
$I imaginable, I crave leave to be sensible of your favours, and to
$I be sorry it lies not in my power to make acknowledgments that
$I may bear any proportion with them, I could not forbear saying
$I this much to you, and send you half a dozen lines of acknowledgment
$I after you had spent the greatest part of twelve days in a
$I most troublesome affair of mine. And therfore pray pardon me,
$I and believe that I have no compliments for you, though I have
$I all the true esteem and affection one friend can have for another.

<p. 167

$I I fear Mr. Stratton is but a slow man of london. I put something
$I into one of my letters to you to quicken him. Whether you
$I received it, or thought fit to make use of it, I know not. But in
$I good earnest it were better that little tenement were reduced
$I into money, than to yield no other income but trouble to me or
$I my friends, though I doubt whether chapmen are there to be
$I had.
$I    I was sorry to hear by yours of 30th August of the death of your
$I man. I suppose without the help of instances in your view you
$I know of what value a trusty servant is.
$I    Though I gave you an account by memorandum that I
$I thought ablele trees were to be got as good or better nearer home
$I than from hence, it was not to spare myself the trouble of send_ing
$I them, since I have not so much pleasure in anything as when
$I I am doing you some service. I have therefore taken order to
$I have some got for you, therefore pray take order with Mr.
$I Elwill about them, for to him they will be consigned. With
$I them you will also receive some Muscovy or Russian cabbage
$I seed, and some blood red cabbage seed, which they look on here
$I as the wholesomest of all; and perhaps not without reason, for
$I let me tell you this as a thing worth your remembrance, that it
$I is one of the best remedies I know against the scurvy. Besides
$I boiling of it, as we do our cabbage ordinarily, they use it here
$I also raw as their constant winter salad, having always a store
$I of them for the winter, which I am told the gardeners preserve
$I by laying them in straw in deep holes dug into the ground on
$I purpose. Their way of using them for salads is this: they take
$I a cabbage and slice as much of it off as will serve for the present
$I meal, just as you would slice a cucumber. Whereby the leaves
$I being cut across fall into little shreds, which look handsomely in
$I the dish, and dressed with oil and vinegar is no ill salad. And
$I if you keep your counsel well I believe be scarce known what it
$I is, and the truth is, being very wholesome, if I were there I would
$I bring it into use under some fine new name, for after I had been
$I a little accustomed to it I eat it with pleasure.
$I    I wonder you had not heard by the 2nd of October of several
$I sorts of seeds sent you by a neighbour of yours, and the third
$I book De intellectu humano sent by the same hand. Pray when
$I you go to market enquire after them, if you have no news of
$I them sooner.

<p. 168

$I    But to return to the ablele trees, pray what do you mean by
$I so great a number of them? It is true they are quickly up, but
$I what are they good for when grown? If you cannot learn that
$I the timber is good for something, I advise you to plant no more
$I of them than you have need of for some present shade or shelter.
$I For if they are not good timber, they are not beautiful; there is
$I nothing recommends them but their quick growth, and for me
$I I little value unless it be some present need things that are soon
$I ripe and soon rotten. Indeed, I have heard that their boards are
$I almost as good as deal for floorings of rooms and dry uses, but
$I I doubt it. In a rich soil like yours where all things grow so well,
$I I should choose to have a walk up to the front of the house of
$I limes only for beauty, two rows of a side, and a space between
$I them as broad as the front of your house, or ten or fifteen foot
$I broader, as I formerly told you. But behind the house I would
$I have a walk of the same fashion of elms, and on the sides of
$I other useful trees (perhaps oak should be one), which will serve
$I for beauty and use too, and pay for their standing. Abeles
$I I would only place either where others will not grow, or where I
$I have need of a present fence, and then I would place oaks amongst
$I them, or behind them, which is better, which might do the
$I business when they are gone: but not knowing your design,
$I I talk at random though with a good intention.
$I    Pray remember me to your Spa friends. Pray observe nicely
$I without letting them perceive that you do so, how I stand in
$I each of their books. We had some pleasant scenes here, which
$I would come into the history of my travels, if I were with you to
$I tell them.
$I    The promise of lime tree seeds has failed me. The seedsman
$I tells me the skipper brings word that he came too late to Norway.
$I I fear this an excuse, for I had bespoke them before you writ
$I to me, but what remedy? I must be content with a promise for
$I another year.
$I    I fear by your silence you are not yet provided of a man such
$I as we sought for my young master. Let this (if it be so) in the
$I meantime satisfy you, that none is much better than an unfit one.
$I And if I knew what state he at present was in as to learn_ing,
$I I might perhaps think of some way, wherein he might under
$I your eye improve sufficiently for his years without almost
$I any trouble to you; and so the principles of virtue, sense and

<p. 169

$I breeding which are the main business be preserved and nursed
$I up in the way you have begun, and not all these, as is used, be
$I sacrificed to a little Latin under the management of an ill or
$I imprudent tutor unskilled as it often happens in those essential
$I points.
$I    Though it hath hitherto escaped my pen yet it has been often in
$I my head, to enquire what course you took about your water,
$I and whether you are supplied from the spring we examined
$I when I was there. I have had many projects upon that affair
$I in my head, though I never troubled you with any of them,
$I hoping that your house is well supplied with good water without
$I them.
$I    Pray present my humble service to Madam. I had designed
$I her a long letter by a Lady of her acquaintaince I parted with
$I not long since at the Brill. But finding that other people's
$I letters were refused to be meddled with, I thought it good
$I manners not to give the trouble of any of mine; so that the two
$I Ladies were excused, one from carrying, and the other from
$I reading a long letter from me. But pray tell her she has no
$I great loss in it. For it being past doubt that I am her humble
$I servant with the utmost affection and respect anybody can be,
$I I had nothing to add to it but compliments for my being at that
$I distance, which permits me not those opportunities of performing
$I those parts of duty and gratitude belong to me, and enjoying
$I sometimes at Chipley the company I most desire in the world.
$I                             I am, Sir,
$I                  your most obliged and most humble servant,
$I                              J.L.
$I   Pray remember me to young master and my little pretty
$I Mistress.
$I                              J.
$I    I take it something amiss that you have said nothing par_ticularly
$I of her to me this long time, but I am glad to hear from
$I another hand that all your little ones thrive bravely, for so I am
$I told in a letter I lately received. The news, you may believe,
$I was very welcome, both because I have so much reason to love
$I father and mother and all the family, and also I am glad to find
$I that my plain rustic way of feeding and nursing children has not
$I such hardships in it as to hurt even the tender sex. For I flatter

<p. 170

$I myself that Madam in breeding her daughters has inclined a
$I little to my method.
