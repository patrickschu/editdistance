$I   Sir:  I had forgotten in my last letter to answer
$I the matter you did write in touching Captain
$I Morgan, my man. If he had been here I would
$I have sent him unto you; but he is extreme sick at
$I London, and, as I do understand, in some danger;
$I which I am very  sorry for, for he is a tall gentle_man.
$I He hath the charge of all my soldiers in my
$I ship, and hath done his duty very well. I hope he
$I will answer all honestly and well.
$I   Sir, if the Commissioners be once gone over
$I and that there be a surcease of arms, it shall be but
$I folly and to no purpose for me to lie here. I think
$I both I and the noblemen, leaving sufficient lieu_tenants
$I in our ships, and the officers, as Sir W.

<p. 51

$I Wynter, Mr. Hawkyns and Mr. Borough, remain
$I here with the navy will be sufficient; for before
$I these ships can have their full number of men again
$I it will be a month to gather them, do what we can.
$I And I pray to God we have them when we shall
$I need; for many are gone abroad, and specially the
$I chiefest men; God send me to see such a company
$I together again when need is. I protest it before
$I God I write not this to you because I am weary
$I with being here; for if it were not for her Majesty's
$I presence I had rather live in the company of these
$I noble ships than in any place. And yet would I be
$I glad that there were something to do. I am more
$I sorrier for the noblemen than any ways for myself;
$I for I would have them save, to spend when need
$I shall be. I do assure you they live here bountifully,
$I and it will be hard finding of such noblemen as
$I these be, so well affected to this service and that
$I will love the sea so well as they do.
$I   Sir, if you think that my continuing here with
$I the navy serve to good purpose, I shall like well of
$I it; but methinks if there be a surcease of arms, then
$I my lying here will make a jest to many, and they
$I have reason. I think it will be a most fittest time
$I to ground our ships in, for now, at our coming out,
$I it was you know on such a sudden as we could not
$I ground but two or three of the middle sort, so as the
$I great ships were not grounded. I have, with the
$I advice of the officers and masters, thought good to
$I begin with some the next spring, and so in a three
$I springs dispatch them all, and have them all in most
$I excellent order by the midst of March, all save the

<p. 52

$I men; and I doubt not but the ships shall prove
$I some notable liars, and if cause fall out, do a better
$I day of service for England than ever ships did for it
$I yet. But this assure yourself if the forces of Spain
$I do come before the midst of April, there will be as
$I much ado to have men to furnish us, as ever was;
$I but men must have, or else the ships will do no
$I good. God knows it is but a bare sight to see us
$I now to that it was, and I would not wish any to take
$I the pains to come to see us till  we are newly sup_plied,
$I when cause shall be. Sir, God send you well
$I to do, and continuance of your health, and so I bid
$I you most heartily farewell. From aboard her
$I Majesty's good ship the Bear, the 28th of January.
$I                 Your assured loving friend,
$I                                   C. HOWARD.
