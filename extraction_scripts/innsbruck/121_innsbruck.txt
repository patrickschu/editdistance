$I To my good Lady, Dame Anne Rokesby, be this delivered.
$I Maddam, after my most louely I recomend me to your lady_ship,
$I evermore desiring to wit of your good wellfare, which is my
$I dayly prayer to Jesus to inquete to your harts most comfort.

$I wroth with my husband for the money that he received of my  M=rs=
$I your daughter, that he send not to you by this bearrer. It was
$I my consent;  for in good faith, madam, in a maner we weare eether
$I to have lost our farme, for M=r= Trey is so trobled in the law, that
$I he may not forbeare his rent no whyle. Madam, I bad my hus_band

$I be discontent for your money for a season; the which shall be

$I we must have else sold iij of our key, the which had bene a great
$I hindrance to us. For in good faith we buy that we spend in our
$I house, and I am faine to eate browne bread and drink small alle
$I myselfe, and lives as hardly, as God knowes, and must do for this
$I yeare. I trust to God it shall be ammended the next yeare; for, I
$I thank God, we had not a better cropp toward this good whyle.
$I And God reward your Ladyship;  we had lived most hardly, if
$I that your Ladyship had not bene. And I pray you, madam, let
$I not my M=rs=. your daughter wit of it, for then she will never trust
$I my husband, nor me. God reward hir, which I am much bownd
$I unto. I can doe nothing for your Ladyship and hir, but for to
$I pray for your prosperete. I pray you, madam, let not my hus_band
$I know of this letter, and send me word trewly with this
$I bearrer in a little bill of your owne hand, ij or iij words, that he
$I know not of your mind. No more, but Jesus kepe your Lady_ship
$I in good health.
$I By your power beadwoman,
$I Ann Abott.
