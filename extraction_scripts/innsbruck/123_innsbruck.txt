$I Maister Almoner, what comfort I have with the
$I good tydings of yo=r= lettre I nede not write it to you,
$I for the veray reason that I have, sheweth it. The
$I Vic_torye hath been soo grete that I think noon suche
$I hath been seen befor. Al England hath cause to thanke
$I God of it, and I specially, seing that the King begyn_neth
$I soo well; whiche is to me a grete hope that thende
$I shalbe like. I pray God sende the same shortly, for
$I if this contynue soo still, I truste in hym that every
$I thing shal folowe thereafter to the Kings pleasur and
$I my comfort. M. Almoner, for the payne ye take
$I re_membring to write to me soo often, I thanke you for it
$I w=t= al my hert, prayeng you to contynue stil sending
$I me worde how the King doeth, and if he kepe stil his
$I good rule as he beganne. I thinke w=t= the companye
$I of themperor and w=t= his good counsaill his Grace shal

<p. 85

$I not aventure hymself soo moche as I was aferde of
$I befor. I was veray gladde to here the metyng of
$I thaym both, which hath been to my semyng the
$I grettest honor to the King that ever came to Prince.
$I Themperor hath doon every thing like himself. I
$I trust to God he shalbe therby knowen for oon of
$I thexcellentest Princes in the Worlde, and taken for a
$I nother man than he was befor thought. M. Almoner
$I I thinke myself that I am soo bounde to hym for my
$I part, that, in my Lettre, I beseche the King to recommende me
$I vnto hym, and if his Grace thinketh that this shalbe
$I wel doon I prav you to remembre it. Newes from_hens
$I I have noon; but suche as I ... suer the coun_saill
$I have advertised the King of, and therby ye shal
$I see howe Almighty God helpeth her our part aswel as
$I ther. I trowe the cause is (a . . . here saye) that
$I the King disposeth hymself to hym soo wel that I hope
$I al . . shalbe the better for his merits. And w=t= this I
$I make an ende. At Riche . . . the xxv=ti=  day of 
$I August.

$I cause it is noo nede herin to trouble your Grace with
$I long writing, but, to my thinking, this batell hath bee
$I to your Grace and al your reame the grettest honor
$I that coude bee, and more than ye shuld wyn al the
$I crown of Fraunce;  thankend bee God of it: and I
$I am suer your Grace forgetteth not to doo this, which
$I shal be cause to send you many moo suche grete vic_toryes,
$I as I trust he shal doo.    My husband, for has_tynesse,

$I kepe my premys, sending you for your baners a Kings
$I cote. I thought to sende hymself unto you, but our
$I Englishemens herts wold not suffre it.    It shuld have
