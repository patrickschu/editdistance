$I To my right worshipfull Coussin, Mr. William Plompton of Plomp_ton,
$I                    esquire, this deliver.
$I   Cossin Plompton, I hartely recommend me unto you, thankyng
$I you for all your goodnes at all times. I have received your letter
$I by Roger Brindell, and wheare that ye wryte there is no dowghts

<p. 249

$I if the matter had come to comunication; ye ar the man that I
$I trust, and by you I wold have bene ordered: and if ye had so
$I thought, I wold have confeined myselfe to you: But I perceive
$I the parte is not minded to commone with him; his wife thinks
$I him to light. And I think, consider his Qualeties, his living, his
$I posabilete, and confer al toghether, I think as good chepe as this I
$I shall git a living for him, both as good and as fare. And I am
$I sur ther haith bene comredis won with other far wars then he, excep
$I one faute. And as for that, ther is and haith bene many good
$I men with that faut; it is the thing that he cannot amend. It lets
$I him not to eat, drink, slepe; he can live as well of it I have
$I given him, as though it had descendit to him. And if his bro_ther
$I dy without isew, in all by gift he shall have v hundreth mark
$I land, (and if he wear but inhiretable by the law, he shold be heir
$I to him, but for defaut of heireship, I thinke he will not change his
$I estate in this case;) and for defaute of heires of my body lawfuly be_gotten,
$I he shall inhirit all that I have. But in the meane onely, his
$I fault so shall not hirt him in no profets. Let this matter pas: He is
$I much bownd to you, and if ever he be able, to do you plea_sure.
$I I trust ye shull se him git a living, ere the yeare is past.
$I At York, if ye will come and kill a hind, ye shall be hertyly
$I welcom. Wryten at Sothill, the xxviii of November. Anno
$I 1544; 36 H. 8.
$I                    Your asured frind, Henry Savill, knt.
