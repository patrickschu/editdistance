$I   "To the Worthiest Lady Mrs. Magdalen Herbert.
$I   "MADAM,  As we must die before we can have full
$I glory and happiness, so before I can have this degree of it,
$I as to see you by a letter, I must also die, that is, come to
$I London, to plaguy London  a place full of danger and
$I vanity and vice, though the Court be gone; and such it
$I will be till your return redeem it. Not that the greatest
$I virtue in the world, which is you, can be such a marshal
$I as to defeat or disperse all the vice of this place; but as
$I higher bodies remove, or contract themselves, when better
$I come, so at your return we shall have one door open to
$I innocence. Yet, madam, you are not such an Ireland as
$I produceth neither ill nor good; no spiders nor nightingales,
$I which is a rare degree of perfection. But you have found
$I and practised that experiment that even Nature, out of her
$I detesting of emptiness, if we will make that our work to
$I remove bad, will fill us with good things. To abstain
$I from it was therefore but the childhood and minority of
$I your soul, which had been long exercised since, in your
$I manlier active part of doing good. Of which since I have
$I been a witness and subject, not to tell you sometimes, that
$I by your influence and example I have attained to such a
$I step of goodness, as to be thankful, were loth to accuse
$I your power and judgment of impotency and infirmity. 
$I Your Ladyship's in all services,         JOHN DONNE.
