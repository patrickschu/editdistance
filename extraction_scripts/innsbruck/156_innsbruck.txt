$I   It may like your highnes to call to your gratious
$I remembrance, [that] at such tyme as [of] your great
$I weightie roome of Chauncellourshipp (vnto the which,
$I farr aboue my merites, your highnes of your incomparable
$I goodnes exalted me vnto) you were so good and gratious
$I vnto me [as], at my humble suite, to disburden me
$I (giuing me licence, with your gratious favoure, to bestow
$I the residue of my life to come about the prouision of my
$I soule in the seruice of god). It pleased your highnes
$I further [to say vnto me] that, for the seruice I had done,
$I that in any suite I should haue hereafter to your Grace

<p. 183

$I that either should concerne myne honure or appertaine
$I to my profitt (for these verie wordes it liked your high_nes
$I to vse to me) I should find your highnes my good and
$I gratious Lord. So it is now, gratious Soueraigne, that
$I worldlie honoure is the thing whereof I haue resigned
$I both the possession and the desire, in the surrender
$I of your honorable office; and as for worldlie profitt,
$I I trust experience proveth, and daylie more and more
$I shall proue, that I was never verie greedie thereof.
$I   But now is my most humble suite to your excellent
$I Highnes, to beseech it somewhat to tender my poore
$I honestie; howbeit, principalllie, that of your accustomed
$I goodnes, no sinister information can otherwise moue
$I your noble Grace to haue any mistrust of my troth and
$I devotion towardes your maiestie then I haue or shall
$I giue iust cause, which I hope there is none. For in this
$I matter of the Nunne of Canturburie I haue vnto your
$I trustie Counsellour, maister Thomas Cromewell, by my
$I writing as plainely declared the truth as * I possiblelie *
$I can; which my declaration, * as I vnderstand, * is
$I made knowne to your noble Grace.

<p. 184

$I   Of all my dealing[e] with the Nunne, whether any
$I other man may paraduenture put any doubt, or moue
$I any scruple of any other meaning than I had, that can
$I I neither tell, nor lieth in my hand to lett, but vnto
$I my selfe it is not possible anie part of my demeanour
$I to seem euell; And this the clereness of my conscience
$I testifying that in that matter, my mynde, intent and
$I proceeding was lawfull and good. Wherfor, most
$I gratious Soueraigne, I neither will, nor yet can [it] well
$I become me, with your Highnes to reason or argue the
$I matter; but in most humble manner, prostrate at your
$I Graces feet, I beseech your Maiestie, with your owne
$I high prudence and accustomed goodnes, consider and
$I weigh the matter. And if that in your so doing, your
$I owne verteous minde shall giue you, that notwith_standinge
$I your manifold goodnes that your Highnes

<p. 185

$I hath vsed towardes me, that I haue most vnnaturallie
$I and vngratefullie digressed from my bounden dewtie
$I of allegeance towardes your Maiestie, then desire I
$I no further fauour at your Graces handes then the losse
$I of all I may. Let me loose goodes, landes, libertie, &
$I finallie my life. Howbeit, if in the considering of my
$I cause your high wisdome and gratious goodnes shall
$I perceaue that I haue not otherwise demeaned my selfe
$I then may well stand with my bounden dewtie and faith_fullnes
$I towardes your Royall Maiestie, then in most
$I humble manner I beseech your noble Grace that the
$I knowledge of your true gratious persuasion in that
$I behalfe may releeue the torment of my present heavines,
$I conceaued of the dread and feare (by that I heare a gre_vous
$I bill put vp by your learned Counsell vnto your high

<p. 186

$I Court of Parliament against me) lest your Grace might
$I by some sinister information be moued to thincke the
$I contrarie. Which, if your highnes doe not (as I trust in
$I god and your great goodnes, the matter by your wisdome
$I well examined, you will not) then in most humble manner
$I I beseech your highnes furthur, sith your highnes hath
$I here before of your meere abundant goodnes heaped
$I on me both worship and honoure, and sith now I haue
$I left of all such things, and nothinge seeke or desire but
$I the life to come, [and] to pray for your Grace [the]
$I while, that it may like your Highnes of your accustomed
$I benignitie somwhat to tender my poor honestie, and
$I neuer to suffer any man by meane of such a bill, to take
$I occasion against the truthe to slaunder me; although
$I this by the perill of their owne soules would doe them
$I more hurt then me, for I sett[le] my hart to depend
$I vpon the comfort of the truth and the hope of heauen,
$I and not vpon the fallible opinion of some changeable
$I persons.
$I   And th[u]s, most dread and deare soueraigne Lord,
$I I beseeche the blessed Trinitie * preserue your noble
$I Grace, both bodie and soule, and all that are your
$I well willers, and amend the contrarie; emong whome,
$I if euer I be, or ever haue bene one, then I pray god that
$I he may with my open shame and destruction declare it.
