$I Devised to bee sente vnto Maister More.
$I      After my most humble recommendations, Where as I
$I vnderstand by the raport off diuers syc [he] as be my freendis, that
$I you be towerdis me nowe, as you haue bene euer, my especiall
$I good master, I do therefore most humbly thanke you, beseching
$I you off your good continuaunce, and where as I, for your sondrye
$I benefites used vnto me, esteme my ssellff more bownden to you
$I than to any oone man lyving, whyche hytherto I haue hadde
$I neuer other habilite to recompense, but oonly by my word to
$I declare yt, where I haue sene tyme and place conuenient. I beseche
$I you off your goodnesse, for your accustumyd goodnesse to continu
$I vnttyll syche tyme that I may oones trede vnder fote thys horrible
$I monster pouerty, whyche hytherto hath benne so homely wyth
$I me, that sche hath made me aschamyd off my sellff, and many
$I a hunderd tymes to forbere to do my dutye to you by cause I was
$I lothe to cum to your howse with empty handis.
$I   I vnderstande by Sir Wylliam a Parre, that the Kyngis Grace
$I demanded off you and Doctor Stevyns, whyther you thowght yt
$I conuenient that the Duc off Richemont schould lerne Greke and
$I Latyne both at oones, and that bothe you and the saide Doctor

<p. 404

$I duly approue myne opinion in that behalff. Wherefore I do most
$I humbly thanke you, assuring you that for my discharge in that
$I behallff, I haue not oonly demanded the opinions off Horman,
$I Gonnell, Ryghtwyse and all suche as I thowght cowld any thyng
$I instruct me, howe I schould best acquite me in the charge com_myttyd
$I vnto me, but I haue all so diligently redde Quintiliane,
$I Maphes Vegius, Otho Moguntinus, Baptista Guarinus, and espe_cially
$I Herasmus, whyche all, as you knowe, agree in that thing.
$I   But I remember that you schewyd me oones how a lytyll Latine
$I schould serue so the saide Duc myght haue Frenshe, and to be
$I playne with you, me thynkyth that our schavyn folk wold in
$I no wyse he schoulde be lernyd. Whyche I assure you were a
$I great pytye, for on my faithe I knewe neuer a more singular wytt,
$I nother ryche nor power, than he hathe, and all be hyt that he
$I hathe all redye and euery day schall haue more and more sondry
$I callers vpon hym to bring hys mynde from learning, som to here
$I a crye at a hare, somm to kyll a bucke with hys bow, somtyme with
$I grayhowndes and somtyme with buckehowndes, and that yt ys
$I not lefull to depart tyll he haue takyn the same, somm to se a

<p. 405

$I flyght with a hawke, somm to ryde a hors, whyche yett he ys
$I not gretly combryd with by cause off hys youthe, bysydes many
$I other diuises fownde within the howse, whan he can not goo
$I abrode, yet I trust, so you be especciall good master to me, to
$I bring hym to that lernyng that you schalbe contentyd worthely
$I to approue, but I beseche you, yff any that ys lernyd schall fortune
$I to cum hyther, by whome you may sufficiently be instructed
$I whyther my raport of hym be trewe or not, that you wyll than after
$I your best maner conferme the Kyngis Grace in the good opinion
$I that he hath all redye to haue hym lernyd.
$I   And to make the chylde loue lernyng, I neuer put him in

$I fere off any maner correction, nor neuer suffer hym to continu
$I at any tyme tyll he schould be weryed, but diuise all the wayes I
$I can possible to make lernyng playsant to hym, in so myche that
$I many tymes hys officers wott not whyther I lerne hym or playe
$I with hym, and yett haue I all redye browght hym to haue a ryght
$I good vnderstanding in the principles off the grammars bothe off
$I Greke and Latine and I haue redde hym an egloga (the fyrst)
$I of Virgile and ii of the fyrst scenes off Adelphorum, whyche he
$I can pronownce ryght pretyly, but I fynde Quintiliane and Heras_mus
$I trewe, for the barbarus tong off hym that tawght hym hys
$I mattens ys and hath bene a great hindrance to me.
$I   I do therfore most instantly require you, that whan you schall
$I se your tymes conuenient, you wyll nyt saff to move the Kingis
$I Grace, that the saide my Lorde of Rychemont may be browght
$I vppe in lernyng, assuring you that Godd hath gevyn hym a great
$I apptnesse bothe to lernyng and all maner suche qua[lities] as
$I schould becum suche noble parson to haue, whych in my mynde
$I were great pitye but that yt schould be employed to the best effect,
$I where in I schall euer do my best according as for hys aage schalbe
$I requisit, and albe hyt that som here whych be hyghe schavyn mur_mur
$I agaynst yt, and after putyng off many parellys, lett not to
$I saye that lernyng ys a great hyndrance and displeasur to a nobyll
$I man, I here theym wyth Vlixes eere[s], praying you as tyme schall
$I seme to you conuenient to tell a nother tale to the Kingis Grace
$I and my Lord Cardinall, thynkyng veryly that you schall ther in
$I do a greater good ded than you wene off, beseching Godde to
$I send you good lyff and long, and whan your dowghters disputyd
$I in philosophie afore the Kyngis Grace, I wold yt hadde bene my
$I fortune to be present.
