$I   To those Gentlemen his quondam acquaintance, that spend their wits in
$I making playes, R. G. wisheth a better exercise, and wisedome to preuent his
$I extremities.
$I   If wofull experience may mooue you, gentlemen, to beware, or vnheard-of
$I wretchednes intreat you to take heed, I doubt not but you will look backe with
$I sorrow on your time past, and endeuour with repentance to spend that which is to
$I come. Wonder not (for with thee will I first beginne), thou famous gracer
$I of tragedians, that Green who hath said with thee, like the foole in his heart,
$I "There is no God", should now giue glorie vnto his greatnesse; for penetrating
$I in his power, his hand lyes haeuy vpon me, he hath spoken vnto me with a
$I voyce of thunder,and I haue felt he is a God that can punish enemies. Why
$I should thy excellent wit, his gift, be so blinded that thou shouldest giue no glory to
$I the giuer? Is it pestilent Machiuilian policie that thou hast studied; O peevish§
$I follie! what are his rules but meere confused mockeries, able to extirpate in small
$I time the generation of mankinde? for if sic volo, sic iubeo, holde in those that are able
$I to commaund, and if it be lawfull fas et nefas, to doo any thing that is beneficiall,
$I onely turants should possesse the earth, and they, striuing to exceed in tiranny,
$I should ech to other be a slaughterman, till, the mightyest out-liuing all, one stroke
$I were left for Death, that in one age mans life should end. The broacher of this
$I dyabolicall atheisme is dead, and in his life had neuer the felicitie he aymed at, but,
$I as he beganne in craft, liued in feare, and ended in dispaire. Quam inscrutabilia sunt
$I Dei iudicia! This murderer of many brethren had his conscience seared like Cayne;
$I this betrayer of him that gaue his life for him inherited the portion of Judas; this
$I apostata perished as ill as Julian: and wilt thou, my friend, be his disciple; Looke
$I vnto mee, by him perswaded to that libertie, and thou shalt finde it an infernall
$I bondage. I know the least of my demerits merit this miserable death; but wilfull
$I striuing against knowne truth exceedeth all the terrors of my soule. Deferre not,
$I with mee, till this last point of extremitie; for little knowest thou how in the end
$I thou shalt be visited.

<p. 60

$I   With thee I ioyne young Juuenall, that byting satyrist, that lastly with mee
$I together writ a comedie. Sweet boy, might I aduise thee, be aduised, and get not
$I many enemies by bitter words: inueigh against vaine men, for thou canst doo it, no
$I man better, no man so well; thou hast a libertie to reprooue all and name none:
$I for one being spoken to, all are offended, - none being blamed, no man is iniuried.
$I Stop shallow water still running, it will rage; tread on a worme, and it will turne;
$I then blame not schollers who are vexed with sharpe and bitter lines, if they reprooue
$I thy too much liberty of reproofe.
$I   And thou no lesse deseruing then the other two, in some things rarer, in
$I nothing inferiour, driuen, as myselfe, to extreame shifts, a little haue I to say to
$I thee; and, were it not an idolatrous oath, I would sweare by sweet S. George, thou
$I art vnworthy better hap, sith thou dependest on so meane a stay. Base-minded
$I men all three of you, if by my misery yee bee not warned; for vnto none of you,
$I like me, sought those burs to cleaue; those puppits, I meane, that speake from our
$I mouths, those anticks garnisht in our colours. Is it not strange that I to whome
$I they all haue bin beholding, is it not like that you to whom they all haue
$I bin beholding, shall, were yee in that case that I am now, be both of
$I them at once forsaken? Yes, trust them not; for there is an vpstart crow 

<p. 61

$I beautified with our feathers, that, with his Tygres heart wrapt in a players hyde,
$I supposes hee is as well able to bombast out a blanke-verse as the best of you; and
$I beeing an absolute Iohannes-fac-totum, is in his owne conceyt the onely Shake-scene
$I in a countrey. Oh, that I might intreat your rare wittes to bee imployed in more
$I profitable courses, and let these apes imitate your past excellence, and neuer more
$I acquaynte them with your admyred inuentions! I knowe the best husband of you
$I all will neuer prooue an usurer, and the kindest of them all will neuer prooue a kinde
$I nurse: yet, whilst you may, seeke your better maisters; for it is pitty men of such
$I rare wits should bee subiect to the pleasures of such rude groomes.
$I   In this I might insert two more that both haue writte against these buckram
$I gentlemen: but let their owne worke serue to witnesse against theyr owne wicked_nesse,
$I if they perseuer to maintaine any more such peasants. For other new
$I commers, I leaue them to the mercie of these painted monsters, who, I doubt not,
$I will driue the best-minded to despise them: for the rest, it skills not though they
$I make a ieast at them.
$I   But now returne I again to you three, knowing my miserie is to you no newes;
$I and let me heartilie intreate you to be warned by my harmes. Delight not, as I
$I haue done, in irreligious oaths, for from the blasphemers house a curse shall not
$I depart. Despise drunkennes, which wasteth the wit, and maketh men all equall
$I vnto beasts. Flie lust, as the deathsman of the soule, and defile not the temple of

<p. 62

$I the Holy Ghost. Abhorre those epicures whose loose life hath made religion loath_some
$I to your eares; and when they sooth you with tearms of mastership, remember
$I Robert Greene, whome they haue often so flattered, perishes now for want of comfort.
$I Remember, gentlemen, your liues are like so many light tapers, that are with care
$I deliuered to all of you to maintaine: these with wind-puft wrath may be ex_tinguished_,
$I with drunkennesse put out, with§ negligence let fall; for mans time of
$I tselfe is not so short but it is more shortened by sinne. The fire of my life is now
$I at the last snuffe, and the want of wherewith to sustaine it, there is no substance for
$I life to feed on. Trust not, then, I beseech yee, left to such weake stayes; for they
$I are as changeable in minde as in many attires. Well, my hand is tyred, and I am
$I forst to leaue where I would beginne; for a whole booke cannot contain their
$I wrongs, which I am forst to knit up in some few lines of wordes.
$I       Desirous that you should liue, though himselfe be dying,
$I                                                        ROBERT GREEENE.
