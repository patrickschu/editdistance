$I   After humly salutacyon, with dew reuerence, I certyffy your
$I masterhepp þat I am now in skotlond, in a lytle vnyuersyte or study
$I namyd Glasco, wher I study & practyce physyk, as I haue done in
$I dyuerce regyons & prouynces, for þe sustentacyon off my lyuyng;
$I assewryng yow þat in the partes þat I am yn, þe kynges grace hath
$I many, 3e, (& in maner) all maner of persons (exceppt some skolasty_call
$I men) þat be hys aduersarys, & spekyth parlyus wordes. I
$I resortt to þe skotysh kynges howse, & to þe erle of Aryn, namyd
$I Hamylton, & to þe lord evyndale, namyd stuerd, & to many lordes
$I & lardes, as well spyrytuall as temporall, & truly I know þer myndes,
$I for þei takyth me for a skotysh manes sone. for I name my selff
$I Karre, & so þe Karres kallyth me cosyn, thorow þe which I am in
$I the more fauer. shortly to conclude, trust yow no skott, for they
$I wyll yowse flatteryng wordes, & al ys fal[s]holde. I suppose, veryly,

<p. 60

$I þat yow haue in ynglond, by-3end x thowsand skottes, & innumerable
$I oþer alyons, which doth (specyally þe skottes) much harme to the
$I kynges leege men thorowh þer ewyll wordes. for as I wentt thorow
$I ynglond, I mett, & was in company off, many rurall felows, englich
$I men, þat loue nott our gracyose kyng. wold to Iesu, þat some wer
$I ponyshyd, to geue oþer example! wolde to Iesu, þat yow hade
$I neuer an alyon in your realme, specyally skottes, for I neuer knew
$I alyon goode to ynglonde, exceppt þei knew profytt & lucre shold
$I com to them, &c. In all þe partes off crystyndom þat I haue
$I trawyllyd in, I know nott v englysh men inhabyours, exceppt only
$I skolers for lernyng. I pray to Iesu þat alyons in ynglond do no
$I more harme to ynglonde! yff I myght do ynglond any seruyce, specy_ally
$I to my soueryn lorde þe kyng, & to yow, I wold do ytt, to spend
$I & putt my lyff in danger & Iuberdy as far as any man, god be my
$I Iuge. Yow haue my hartt, & shalbe sure of me to þe vttermust off
$I my poer power, for I am neuer able to mak yow amendes; for wher
$I I was in greatt thraldom, both bodyly and goostly, yow of your gen_tylnes
$I sett me att liberte & clernes off conscyence. Also I thank
$I your mastershepp for your grett kyndnes, þat yow sheude me att
$I bysheppes waltam, & þat yow gaue me lycence to come to yow ons
$I in a qwartter. as sone as I come home, I pretende to come to yow,
$I to submytt my selff to yow, to do with me what yow wyll. for, for
$I lak of wytt, paraduentter I may in þis wrettyng say þat shall nott
$I contentt yow; but gode be my Iudge, I mene trewly, both to my
$I souerrynge lord þe kyng & to yow. when I was keppt in thrawldom
$I in þe charterhowse, & knew noþer þe kynges noble actes, nor yow;
$I then stultycyusly thorow synystrall wordes, I dyd as many of þat
$I order doth; butt after þat I was att lyberte, manyfestly I aperseuyde
$I þe yngnorance & blyndnes þat they & I war yn: for I could neuer
$I know no thyng of no maner off matter, butt only by them, & they
$I wolde cause me wrett full incypyently to þe prior of london, when
$I he was in þe tower, before he was putt to exicucyon; for þe which
$I I trust your mastershepp hath pardoned me; for god knowth I was

<p. 61

$I keppt in person straytly, & glad I was to wrett att theyr request;
$I but I wrott nothyng þat I thowgt shold be a-genst my prince, nor
$I yow, nor no oþer man. I pray god þat yow may prouyde a goode
$I prior for þat place of london; for truly þer be many wylfull &
$I obstynatt yowng men þat stondyth to much in ther owne consaytt,
$I & wyll not be reformyd, butt playth þe chyldryn; & a good prior
$I wold to serue them lyk chyldryn. News I haue to wrett to yow,
$I butt I pretende to be with yow shortly; for I am halff very off þe
$I baryn contry, as Iesu cryst knowth, who euer keppe yow in helth &
$I honer. ffrom leth, a myle from Edynborowh, þe fyrst day off Apryll,
$I by the hand off your Poer skoler & seruantt
$I [directed on back]                      Andrew Boorde, Preest.
$I To the right honerable esquire, Master
$I Thomas Cromwell, hygh secretary to
$I þe Kynges grace.
