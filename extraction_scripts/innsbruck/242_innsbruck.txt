$I WORTHY PRINCE AND MY DEAREST BROTHER:
$I I received your most welcom Letter and kynd
$I token by M=r=. Hopkins, highly esteeming them as 
$I memorials of your brotherly love. In which 
$I assuredly (whatsoever ells may fayle) I will ever en_devor
$I to equall you, esteeming that time happiest 
$I when I enjoyed your company, and desiring nothing
$I more than the fruition of it again: that as nature hath 
$I made us neerest in our love together, so accident
$I might not separate us from living together. Neither 
$I do I account yt the leste part of my present comfort,
$I that though I am deprived of your happy presence,

<p. 91

$I yet I can make these lines deliver this true message, 
$I that I will ever bee during my lyfe
$I Your most kinde and loving syster
$I Elizabeth
$I To my most dear ........brother the Prince.
