$I service we are able. We must first giue you thanks for the kind
$I present you haue pleasd to send us wch will give occasion to us to
$I remember you often, but the quantity is so great that it might make
$I sober men forgetfull. We haue been with my Lord Bellasis &
$I presented him his, and your letter. He giues you very many thanks
$I and as to the businesse of cutting of Hull from Hezle, he answerd
$I what indeed we expected, that he should willingly contribute his best
$I towards it at any time, but it being to be done by Act of Parliament
$I it was at present our dissolution being so sudden, absolutely impossible.
$I Had you pleasd to give order sooner to us it might have bin effected
$I & an Act prepared for it might haue passd but as we said there are
$I so many publick bills depending & our time so short that should you
$I giue a 1000 li it could neuer be got into the house to be once read this

$I Assess. the Excise. Post office & attaindor. We haue deliverd your
$I letters to Mr. Hilyard with words of civility. We haue agreed to treat
$I with him upon munday. We shall be very shy to acquaint him we
$I haue powr to conclude with him. For your Security is perfectly good
$I in Law. We belieue 'twas given you by the Pt in compensation
$I of great losses you sustaind in the Warr. It concerns you much being
$I in the midst of your town. We can not but consider that he has
$I a brother Captain in your garrison & that this Gentleman also has
$I imployd his intrest since he was in this Parlt to continue you
$I a garrison. We hope you will be private in these things comunicated
$I to you out of faithfulness to your intrest & that you will not be
$I hasty in your resolutions nor open one way or other. We shall treat
$I fairly with him & advertise you from time to time what is proposed.
$I Mr. Wilson is returned down this week & hath as farre as we perceiue
$I effected nothing one way or other but Mr. Stiles procured a presentation
$I in his own name for Leeds. We haue not yet seen Mr. Hebard. On
$I Tuesday night last Arguile & Swinton were shipd hence for Scotland
$I in order to their triall there.
