$I D. s., 
$I    Mr Feltham hath been so taken up with his kindred
$I and a journey to Yarmouth & I have been often at
$I Sprowston, that wee have not had the opportunity to be
$I so civill unto him & his freinds as wee desired and in_tended.
$I I was glad to see him & wish him all prosperitie
$I both for his owne sake & of his parents, my loving
$I freinds & acquaintance. His father was a cordiall & very
$I loving freind of myne, & his mother a very good
$I woeman, unto whom wee recommend as many as wee
$I can & his 2 sisters in Norwich are very good woemen.
$I I thought to have sent a spider by him, which was
$I brought mee out of the feilds, large & round & finely
$I marked green, & even allmost as bigge as the figures
$I inclosed drawne by your mother, for your sisters dared
$I not doe it: it may bee seen in Moufetus, & I have had
$I of them before & one drawne out in oyled colours upon
$I an oyled paper. I do not find it in Dr Listers table of

<p. 181

$I spiders, though hee hath writt wel de Araneis. I am glad
$I Sr william went to London for hee would [find] an un_confortable
$I howse at Sprowston, where there are & have
$I been so many sick, as I doubt not butt my L. Adams
$I hath informed Sr William. I hope Mr Adams is much
$I better. My service to Sr William. Madame Burwell hath
$I been better this daye, butt these diseases are most dan_gerous
$I unto persons in yeares. God blesse you all.
$I                   Y.l.f.
$I                         T.B.
$I For Dr Edward Browne in Salisbury court next the
$I golden balls these London
