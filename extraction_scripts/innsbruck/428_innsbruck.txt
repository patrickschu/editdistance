$I To Mr. Bohun.
$I 1671.
$I S=r=,
$I I must believe you are very busy, hearing so sel_dome
$I from you, and that you are much in the
$I esteeme of Dr. Bathurst, since he judges so favour_ably
$I of y=r= friends. It cannot be the effcct of his
$I discernment which makes him give sentence in my
$I behalfe, being so great a master of reason as he is;
$I but it is certainly a mark of his great kindnesse to
$I you that be deffers to y=r= jugment in opposition to
$I his owne. I should not question y=rs= in other thmgs,
$I but the wisest may be allow'd some grains, and I
$I concludc you no lesse a courtier than a philosopher.
$I Since my last to you I have seene "The Siege of
$I Grenada," a play so full of ideas that the most re_fined
$I romance I euer read is not to compare with
$I it: love is made so pure, and valor so nice, that
$I one would imagine it designed for an Vtopia rather
$I then our stage. I do not quarrell with the poet,
$I but admire one borne in the decline of morality
$I should be able to feigne such exact virtue; and as
$I poetic fiction has been instructive in former ages,
$I I wish this the same event in ours. As to the strict

<p. 433

$I law of Comedy I dare not pretend to judge; some
$I thinke the division of the story not as well as if it
$I could all haue ben comprehended in the dayes ac_tions;
$I truth of history, exactness of time, possibili_ties
$I of adventures, are niceties the antient. criticks
$I might require; but tbose who havc outdone them
$I in fine notions may be allowed the liberty to ex_presse
$I them their owne way, and the present world
$I is so enlightened that the old dramatique must bear
$I no sway. This account perhaps is not enough to
$I do Mr. Driden right, yet is as much as you can
$I expect from the leisure of one who has the care of
$I a nursery.
$I I am, Sir, &c.
$I M. Evelyn.
