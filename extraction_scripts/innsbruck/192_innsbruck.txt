$I My Lorde I have a requeste to make unto your
$I Grace wiche feare has made me omitte til this time for
$I two causes, the one bicause I sawe that my request for
$I the rumors wiche were sprede abrode of me toke so
$I litel place, wiche thinge whan I considered I thogth
$I should litel profit in any other sute, howbeit now I

<p. 154

$I understande that ther is a Proclamacion for them (for
$I the wiche I give your Grace and the rest of the coun_sel
$I most humble thankes) I am the bolder to speake
$I for a nother thinge; and the other was bicause par_aventure
$I your Lordeship and the rest of the Counsel
$I wil thinke that I favor her ivel doinge for whome
$I I shal speake for, wiche is for Kateryn Aschiley, that
$I it wolde please your grace and the rest of the Counsel
$I to be good unto her. Wiche thinge I do not to favor
$I her in any ivel, (for that I wolde be sorye to do,) but
$I for thes consideracions wiche folowe, the wiche hope
$I dothe teache me in sainge that I ougth not to doute
$I but that your Grace and the rest of the Counsel wil
$I thinke that I do it for thre other consideracions. First,
$I bicause that she hathe bene with me a longe time, and
$I manye years, and hathe taken great labor, and paine
$I in brinkinge of me up in lerninge and honestie, and
$I therfore I ougth of very dewtye speke for her, for
$I Saint Gregorie sayeth that we ar more bounde to them
$I that bringeth us up wel than to our parents, for our
$I parents do that wiche is natural for them, that is bring_eth
$I us into this Worlde; but our brinkers up ar a
$I cause to make us live wel in it.    The seconde is bi_cause
$I I thinke that whatsoever she hathe done in my
$I Lorde Admirals matter as concerninge the marijnge
$I of me, she dide it bicause knowinge him to be one
$I of the Counsel, she thogth he wolde not go about any
$I suche thinge without he had the Counsels consent

<p. 155

$I therunto; for I have harde her manye times say that
$I she wolde never have me mary in any place without
$I your Graces and the Counsels consente. The thirde
$I cause is bicause that it shal and doth make men thinke
$I that I am not clere of the dide myselfe, but that it is
$I pardoned in me bicause of my youthe, bicause that she
$I I loved so wel is in suche a place. Thus hope pre_vailinge
$I more with me than fear, hath won the battle;
$I and I have at this time gone furth with it. Wiche
$I I pray God be taken no other wais that it is mente.
$I Writen in hast. Frome Hatfilde this 7 day of Marche.
$I Also if I may be so bolde not offendinge I beseche
$I your Grace and the rest of the Counsel to be good to
$I master Aschiley her husbonde, wiche bicause he is my
$I kindesman I wold be glad he shulde do well.
$I Your assured frende to my litel
$I power
$I ELIZABETH.
$I To my verey good Lorde my Lorde Protector.
