$I   My honourable good Lord:  I do understand by
$I Mr. CÃ¦sar how much I am bound unto your Lord_ship
$I for your honourable favour. I have no ways to
$I recompense it but with my love and service, which
$I your Lordship shall be most assured ever of.
$I   It may be there hath been some report made to
$I your lorship of some chance that happened here,
$I before my coming down, by fire iN one of the ships;
$I and because I do understand that it is reported that
$I it should be done by Ascott, I do assure your Lord_ship

$I it was after this manner. There were two poor
$I knaves that came from Westchester that strived for
$I a place to hang up their netting for to lie in, and the
$I one of them had a piece of a candle in his hand, and
$I in strving, the candle fell down where there lay
$I some oakum. It might have bred some mischief,
$I but it was quickly put out. It was in the Elizabeth
$I Bonaventure; but I hope to make them a warning
$I to otheres to beware.
$I   I am bold to send you by this bearer, my man,
$I the copy of a  proclamation which I have drawn and
$I proclaimed in my own ship, and shall be this day and
$I to-morrow proclaimed in the rest. I am but a bad
$I drawer of a proclamation, but it shall serve, I hope
$I for to prevent some ill that might happen.
$I   My good Lord, this bearer, my man, shall always
$I attend at the court, and shall attend on your Lord_ship
$I always to know your pleasure, if you will com_mand
$I him anything unto me. And so, resting
$I always most beholden unto your Lordship and most
$I ready to do your Lordship any service, I humbly
$I take my leave. Aboard her Majesty's good ship the
$I White Bear, the 24th of December 1587.
$I      Your Lordship's most assured to command
$I                                      C. Howard.
