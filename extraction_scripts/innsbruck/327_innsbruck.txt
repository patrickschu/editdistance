$I    My very goode Lord: I am sory to see our yll newes so fully con_firmed
$I by yours of the 7=th= of this present, but more sory for your niece
$I Dakers, whose case is every way to be pitied. I cannot so much lament
$I the rest whose lives were well bestowed to redeeme us out of so dull a
$I lethargie, and to make the world see our wonted courage is notquite lost:
$I for I could never commend those warie gamesters that rather then ven_ture
$I to set up a small rest sometimes wold loose all their monie in stakes.
$I We talke of a rich Holland East Indian ship that lay last weeke two
$I whole dayes in the Downes, in sight of the Kings ships that wold not see
$I her, wherby we may easilie perceve how the world goes. Our souldiers
$I passe daylie towards Plimmouth where Sir John Ogle and others are to
$I traine and discipline them. The common speach runs of 15000 land
$I souldiers at least; a band of Bedfordshire men (they say) have killed their
$I lieutenant or conductor and are run away and dispersed. We have now
$I almost every day posts out of Fraunce that bring word the Quene is on
$I her way by this time as far as Amiens, where she is to tarrie three dayes
$I and makes acoount to be at Bologne by Whitsunday eve,  and here the
$I Saturday after. The French king promises to overtake her at Amiens
$I and there take his leave, but the Quene regnant and Quene mother ac_companie
$I her to the sea-side, so that we are like to have three Queens at
$I Bullen to aunswer the three kinges of Cullen. the King goes hence on
$I Tewsday thorough to Caunterburie and so to Dover. the pencioners
$I and some of the traine are gon before, but the formost were the Mar_quise
$I Hamilton, the countesses of Buckingam, Denbigh and Anglesey
$I with the French Lady Carie who went away on Thursday with intent
$I to go to Bologne, where the Lady Carie sayes she must cast her self at
$I the Quene dowagers feet for auncient favors. Here is a new world of
$I Scottish men come, thirty Lords at least in the court atonce, but yt is
$I hoped the Kings journy will disperse them; there is no remedy (they say)
$I but the King must go into Scotland to be crowned: which yet he may

$I do at leasure I hope. Our weekely bill is not much risen this weeke,
$I there beeing 401 in all, of the plague 78, parishes infected sixteen; the
$I Lord of Bristow is saide to be very sicke and in daunger. Quester was
$I overthrowne this day sevenight in a suit about the post masters office,
$I wherin the Lord Stanhop prevailed against him. This day a great
$I cause and that hath long depended was determined in the exchequer
$I chamber twixt the Lord Sheffeild and one Ratcliffe, wherin Ratcliffe
$I went to the wall to his utter undooing. I was minded to send a list of
$I the Ladies that are apointed to meet the Quene at Dover, but yt varies
$I and alters so often that it were to no purpose: their number is about
$I fowre or five and twentie all their coaches furnished with sixe horses
$I which comes altogether now in fashion, a vanitie of excessive charge and
$I of litle use. Your brother Carleton was in towne this weeke but after
$I his wont came to fetch fire (as they say) and taried not above two dayes.
$I The Lord of Arundell hath plaide a frendly part with the Lady Fan_shaw
$I and caused the King to send for all her pictures great and small:
$I which may serve for a caveat that yf you bring home any you esteem, he
$I may be the last shold see them, least he reape the thancks a vostre despens.
$I Young Master Fanshaw recommends this letter to his brother yf he
$I may be found, for yt seemes he obscures himself and wold not that any
$I of his frends shold know what becomes of him, nor what course he meanes
$I to take, or under what captain, colonell or generall he hath put himself
$I that they may know how to heare of him: yf you can learn by any that
$I come from the armie or by any other meanes, what he doth yt wilbe held
$I for a great favor from your Lordship. So with the remembrance of
$I my best service to my goode Lady I commend you to the protection of
$I the Almighty. From London this 28=th= of May 1625.
$I                          Your Lordships most assuredly
$I                                 at commaund
$I                                   JOHN CHMAMBERLAIN.
$I To the right honorable Sir Dudley Carleton knight Lord Ambassador
$I for his Majestie at the Hagh.
