$I DEAR CORNWALLIS
$I IF this honest man had not offered me a means
$I to convaigh these lines to you, I had sent a foote_man

<p. 52

$I of my owne with them, to lett you know that
$I though business hear falls out as crossely to my
$I purpos of coming to you at this tyme as can be,
$I (the K.s jorney to Theatford being stayed,) yett
$I nothing shall make me leave you longer in doubt
$I that I make promisses to you I intend not to per_forme;
$I therefore you may be confident that if the
$I hand of God Almighty impose not the contrary,
$I I will be with you about a fortnight hence, though
$I I cannot yett name the certain day, because I canâ€¾ot
$I well leave this towne till the Court removes to
$I Grenwidge, which will be about that tyme, but no
$I day yett sett; my stay with you will be so short
$I as I wish you wold resolve my journey might be
$I to fetch you to London; whear I might have yor
$I company longer, for necessity will compel me to
$I goe and come post, and rest but one day with you;
$I which I know you will alowe when you shall un_derstand
$I the occasions command my being hear,
$I which I reserve till we meet; hoping that desired
$I tyme to be now so near, yett so long I will not
$I defer all my thankes to Mr Bacon; of whos care
$I to do me the kindnes I unmannerly desired of him
$I for some good pieses of paintinge, your chaplain
$I hath been a faithful relator and made me a thanke_lesser
$I debtor; which you both shall find if ever
$I it be in my power to witness how unfeignedly I am
$I Your faithfullest freind, L. BEDFORD.
$I [April 1618.] To my dear and worthy freind the Lady Cornewallis.
