$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I THE Lady Barrington made soe short a stay in
$I London after the receipt of your letter, that shee
$I could doe littell in the busines: what shee did I
$I hope she hath or will shortly let you know, yet I
$I thought fitt to tell you what I know conserning it
$I from her. Shee went to the father and tould him
$I that out of her loue to him, and the good opinion
$I she had of his daughter, she came to propound a
$I worthy match to him for her, which she knew he
$I would giue her thanckes for, when he knew wher
$I it was; which before he should doe, she desired to
$I know if she weare free, or he had noe treaty with
$I any for her, to which he replied, he could not yet
$I giue her any answer, but retorned her many
$I thankes for her offer, though I thinke he knew not
$I whoe it was she wished him. She is extreame
$I sory she could doe noe more in it now; but at the
$I next tearme she will be heare againe, and then
$I shee tould me she would doe you the best seruis she
$I could: in the meane time, if I heare of any other, I
other, I

<p. 225

$I will lett you know of it, for I doe most ernestly
$I desire to se him maried, becaues I persaued a
$I wandring humor in him when he was at London,
$I and a resolution this spring to goe into France, yet
$I not without your leaue, as he saied. I resaued this
$I muff from my cosen Copinger latly, and, sins you
$I weare pleased to like the other that came from
$I thens, I venture to present this to you, and with it
$I the best seruis of
$I Your most louing, faithfull, and humbell seruant,
$I          DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
$I Desember 7 [1629].
