$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I I CAN let noe mesenger pass without the remem_brance
$I of my loue and seruis to you. This toune
$I afords noe newes, onely this, which I thinke you

<p. 132

$I will be sory for, that Mrs Anne and Mrs Ueare
$I Cooks are become soe much the prouder sins
$I thay weare aires; for thar brother is uery latly
$I deade of a burning feauor, and the land fales be_twene
$I them. My ould Lady Cook presents her
$I seruis to you, and is a sade woman for the ruine of
$I her howes. My Lady Nethersole is not yet gone,
$I but goes shortly. Thus, with the remembrans of
$I my neuer enough aknowledged loue and seruis to
$I you, I rest your most faithfull frend and humble
$I seruant.           DOROTHE RANDOLPHE.
