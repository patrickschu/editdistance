$I DEARE SISTER,
$I ALLTHOUGH I cannot bee soe happie to receiue
$I yoe lines, yett yoe kind rememberance hath not
$I failed to give mee an assured testimonie of yoe
$I ferme and conciderable affection in condicending
$I vnto my request, coming in a time soe acceptable,
$I yt, had it not bine, I and mine had not had where
$I wthall to haue subsisted; therefore thinke yt ye haue
$I releeued soe many dieing soules, wch had suffered,
$I had not God ordained y° to bee ye meanes of our
$I presaruation.  To this day my husband is still att
$I Arnheim, and is so misearablely intreted by there
$I iniustice, yt in this spase of a yeare hee hath not
$I bine able to send mee any monie or to come vnto
$I mee, and through his heuie troubbles and wantes
$I hee is grone very sickelie, and hath of late bine soe
$I extreme ill, yt those yt ware neere him was doubt_full
$I of his recouerie; and allthough it is in these
$I partes ill trauelling in ye winter sesone, yet I doe
$I intend to goe and see him, and to leaue my chill_dren
$I att my howse in ye Hage vntill my retorne,
$I for there is noe venturing to take them wth me; but
$I my resolution is to come suddinelie bake againe.
$I Thus, wth my prayers vnto the Allmightie to pre_sarue
$I y° and all yors in these dangerous times from

<p. 305

$I all calamities, I commit yo vnto His protection,
$I and rest Yo' most affectshonatt sister to my end,
$I          ANNA MEAUTYS.

$I Hage, ye 5th of Jenuary, ye nue stile, 1644.
$I To my most deare aud much honoured sister, the Lady Bacon, att
$I Culford.
