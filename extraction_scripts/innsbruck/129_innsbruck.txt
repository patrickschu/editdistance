$I Lord God I shall follow every day more and more.
$I How lovingly the king my husband dealeth with
$I me, the lord chamberlain, with other of your ambas_sadors,
$I can clearly inform your grace, whom I
$I beseech your grace heartily to thank for their great
$I labours and pains that they have taken as here for

$I perfect end. As touching mine almoner, I thank
$I your grace for him, Of his demeanour here your
$I grace shall be informed better than I can write; as
$I knoweth our Lord Jesu, who preserve your grace.
$I Amen.
