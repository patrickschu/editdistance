$I It is no small greyf to me to parceyve that they
$I whom the Kyngs Ma=te=. my father (whose soule God

<p. 162

$I pardon) made in thys worlde of nothyng in respecte
$I of that they be comme to nowe, and at hys last ende
$I put in trusts to se hys Wyll perfourmed, wherunto
$I they were all sworne upon a boke; it gryeveth me I
$I say, for the love I beare to theym, to se both howe
$I they breake his Wyll, and what usurped power they
$I take upon theym, in makyng (as they call it) lawes
$I both clean contrarye to hys procedyngs and Wyll, and
$I also ageynst the coustome of all crystendome, and (in
$I my conscyence) ageynst the lawe of God and hys
$I Chyrche, whiche passeth all the reste. But thoughe
$I you, among you, have forgotten the Kyng my father,
$I yet bothe Gods commandment and Nature wyll not
$I suffre me to do so; wherfore wyth Gods helpe I wyll
$I remayne an obedyent chylde to his lawes as he lefte
$I theym, tyll suche tyme as the Kyngs Majestie my
$I brother shall have parfayt yers of discrecyon to ordre
$I the power that God hath sent hym, and to be a Judge
$I in theyse matters hym self; and I doubte not but he
$I shall then accept my so doyng bettre then theyrs which
$I have taken a pece of his power vpon theym in his my_noryte.
$I do not little marvel that you can find fate
$I with me for observyng of that lawe whiche was allowed
$I by hym that was a Kyng not only of power, but also
$I of knowledge howe to order hys power, to whiche
$I lawe all you consented, and semed at that tyme to the

<p. 163

$I outwarde apparance very well to lyke the same, and
$I that you can [could] fynde no fawte all this whiell w=t= some
$I amongste your selfes, for runnyng halfe a yere befor
$I that which you nowe call a lawe, ye and before the by_shopps
$I cam togyther, wherin me thynketh you do me
$I very myche wrong if I shuld not have asmyche pre_emynence
$I to contynew in kepyng a full authorysed
$I lawe made without parcyalyte, as they had, bothe to
$I breake the lawe which at that tyme your selfes muste
$I neds confesse was of full power and strenghe, and to
$I vse alteracyons of theyr owne Invencyon contrarye
$I both to that ye and to your newe lawe as you call it.
