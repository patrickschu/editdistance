$I    Pray doe not take itt ill that I have writt to you soe seldome
$I since my comming to towne, my being in waiting; upon the sad
$I accident of madam's death, (for w=ch= the King endures the
$I highest affliction immaginable) would not allow me time, or
$I power to write letters, you have heard the thing but the
$I barberousness of the manner you may guess att by my relation: 
$I Mounsier, since the bannishment of the Chevallier de Lorrain
$I (of w=ch= hee suspected Madame to have bin the Authour) has ever
$I behav'd himselfe very ill to her in all things, threatning her upon
$I all occasion that if shee did not gett Lorrain recall'd, she myght
$I expect from him the worst that could befall her; it was not now
$I in her power to performe what hee expected, soe that shee
$I returning to Paris, hee immediately carries her away to S=nt= Cloud
$I where having remain'd fifteen dayes, in good health she having
$I bin bathing one morning, and finding her self very dry call'd

<p. 58

$I for some succory water (a cordiall julepp she usually tooke upon
$I these occasions) and being than very merry discoursing w=th=
$I some of the Ladyes that were w=th= her shee had noe sooner
$I swallow'd this succory water but immediately, falling into
$I Madam de Chatillons armes, she cryed she was dead, and
$I sending for her confessour after 8 howers infinite torment in her
$I stomack and bowells she died, the most lamented (both in
$I france & England) since dying has bin in fashion, but I will not
$I keepe you too long upon this dolefull relation it is enough to
$I make most wives in the world very melancholy, but I thanke
$I you for my cheeses, my sugar of roses, & all my good things,
$I pray lett it not bee necessary for mee to put you too often in
$I mind of what you ought not to bee less forward in doing than I
$I in advising, I hope you will give mee noe occasion to explaine
$I my selfe, for if I am putt upon that you will find mee very
$I troublesome, I receiv'd noe letter from you w=th= an inclos'd to y=r=
$I mother nor doe I beleive you writt any, besides I finde by
$I another circumstance that the returnes of letters betwixt London
$I and Adderbury are very tedious; if you write to mee, you must
$I direct to Lincolnsendfeild the house next to the Dukes playhouse
$I in Portugall row, there lives yr humble servant Rochester, I
$I writ a letter to the ranger I would faine know if hee received it
$I and whither I am like to receive an answer or noe, pray send
$I mee some ale and rem[em]ber mee to nan, shee has a present

<p. 59

$I for her godaughter but I doe not know w=ht= it is send mee word
$I and if it bee not as it should bee, Ile send another 
$I                                                     tarara 
$I For the Countess of
$I Rochester att Adderbury
$I neare Banbury Oxfordshire
