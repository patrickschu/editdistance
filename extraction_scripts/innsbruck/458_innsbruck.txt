$I Amsterdam, 4th may, 1686.
$I Sir,
$I      The manner wherewith you continue to speak of the advice
$I I have ventured to send you concerning your son, makes me fear
$I that in perusing it you more regard the intention and friendship
$I of the author, than the meanness of the thing itself; since you
$I so far mistake it as to think that it has laid the debt on your
$I side, and such an one as you imagine you can never get out of;
$I which, when I on the other side consider your favours, I conclude
$I I have all the reason in the world to say in your own words,
$I that I must forever remain your debtor. But to enter into a
$I dispute with you, wherein an excess of friendship makes you
$I obstinate, I have another reason to suspect that your considera_tion
$I for the person that gave it makes you overlook many things
$I in the advice itself, since that I receive not from you any objec_tions
$I about any part of it. For though I must own it is according
$I to the best of my skill, and though I know the affection I writ it
$I with to be very sincere, yet I can by no means fancy my opinion
$I infallible, or that it should in all things so exactly jump with
$I yours and madam's, that you should find nothing (in what is
$I already put in practice) to be added, omitted, or altered, whereof
$I however you say nothing at all. For I doubt not but when
$I I revise the foul copy, which I keep by me on purpose, I shall
$I myself find occasion for additions or alterations.
$I    I do not at all wonder that you have not yet found a tutor
$I to your mind, and I confess the truth somewhat pleased with it.

<p. 163

$I Not that you are hitherto disappointed, but that I perceive that
$I you are more curious in your choice than to take up a venture
$I with the first or second that comes in your way. 'Tis of great
$I consequence to your son, and therfore you cannot be too nice
$I in it. If you could get your cousin to Chipley, a sober, well
$I conditioned young man with moderate learning would do the
$I business, but you know his humour and how averse to trouble
$I especially of some kind.
$I    But as to the law suit I mentioned in my last, I conclude
$I upon second thoughts that it is best to let it perfectly alone
$I without meddling at all in it, any farther than E[arl] P[embroke]
$I himself shall of his own accord discourse of his own concerns
$I and give his advice about it, and then it would perhaps be not
$I amiss to enquire and reason with him for your own satisfaction
$I of the grounds he proceeds on.
$I    As to your Carolina affair, I remember the owner told me it
$I was a Landgraveship of forty-eight thousand acres of land, and
$I the privileges thereunto belonging, which are to be seen in the
$I Fundamental Constitutions. This is enough for your Scotch
$I friend to know to see to what terms he will come, which, when
$I they are judged reasonable or near the matter, the patent now
$I in the executors' hands will be forthcoming, time enough, if the
$I mice have not eaten it, as I believe not, in a strong wooden
$I chest where he was wont to keep it, and which Adrian had the
$I direction to open, which I remember was this: You must turn{figure}
$I the key with the sun once round and a quarter, and then turn
$I it back again half a round and so let it stand. For example, the
$I key put in at the keyhold a must be turned by b-c-d quite to b
$I again, and from b be turned back again to d, and there let stand,
$I and then the lid of the chest may be lifted up. [This] I am sure is
$I the just quantity of the motion that the key must have, and I

<p. 164

$I think for making it you must begin the motion with the sun;
$I but this I do not perfectly remember, and therfore nothing must
$I be forced in the case, for if the contrary motion from a to d and
$I so round be the way to open it, you must do the quite contrary
$I in all things. When it is open you will find one turn to lock it
$I as it does other locks. This much I remember of the lock itself,
$I but where the chest itself is, that the executors know, I for my
$I part know not. This I only know, that if you can persuade
$I my cousin somerton and his wife to make use of it and
$I remove thither (which I should advise him to if the plantation
$I flourishes and promises any good), he may have this interest for
$I acceptance.
$I    As you are content your pictures should remain in the hands
$I of the merchant here that bought them for you, till you have
$I informed yourself concerning that sort of merchandise, and to
$I what port either london or exeter you were best have them,
$I so I find he is not in hast for the slate of the account between
$I you, which therefore you need not be at the pains to send till
$I he demand it. He hopes, as I perceive, that this shall not be the
$I last business he shall have with you, and therfore expects not
$I to have the just balance returned, but an entire sum, something
$I near it may serve the turn. The rest, I perceive, he is not
$I troubled should remain as a nest egg till a farther occasion: as
$I much as I know of him he is a very fair conditioned man, and
$I knows very well your character.
$I    I am glad to hear my Lady King's son thrives so very well,
$I but the Lady I meant is a relation of the Lady that did me the
$I honour to remember to me in your last. Pray present my
$I humble service to her, and let her know I should be glad if there
$I were anything here for her service. My service also to my
$I Valentine Susan, and her man Thomas, and to all you mention
$I in your last letter.
$I    Sutton business dissatisfies me mightily. If that estate will
$I yield nothing by the year, I am of opinion you should sell it and
$I make present money of it; at least the very proposition will
$I quicken the man that deceived you and your aunt so scurvily.
$I    My most humble service to your Lady and little ones.
$I                             I am, Sir,
$I                                your most humble servant,
$I                                  J.L. 

<p. 165

$I    I hope you will talk at large and fully with Adrian. He that
$I copied my last long letter mistook in the names of some books
$I which I much desire you to correct, and for Bacon to set down
$I Chillingworth, and for Tacitus, Tully. I sent you lately a part
$I of my reasonings de intellectu humano, which I hope came safe,
$I for you know we are all concerned for our own conceptions how
$I idle soever.
