$I DEAR MADAM,â€”I think itt very long sinee I
$I heard of you, and therefore send this messenger to
$I bring me word how you doe; from whom I should
$I not have binne so many months without hearing,
$I but that for this two last I have had so much ill
$I health and paine as made me for a good part of
$I the tyme unable to wright, and yett hath left me
$I but a lame woeman. Better nuse I hope to re_seave
$I of you and yours, which I pray for, and shall
$I wellcom with a great deale of gladnes; for this
$I fatall yeare keepes me in continual fears for those
$I I love, which if I did not you hartely, I wear more
$I than unworthy to have a freind. Mr Bacon, I
$I trust, hath by this tyme perfectly recovered his
$I long sicknes, which, both for his owne sake and the comfort
$I of your lyfe, I cannot but with much

<p. 83

$I affection inquier after, and do so to know when
$I you intend to bee att London; where or hear I
$I hope wee shall meete this spring att the fardest, if
$I the towne and these parts continue so cleane from
$I the sicknes as, God be thanked, att the present
$I they are; though all the markett townes about us,
$I and many small villages, Richmondsworth exsept_ed,
$I have all this summer continued infected, as
$I well as the citie, which kept me from sending to
$I those I hoped wear farder from danger for feare of
$I convaighing any to them, though God of his great
$I goodnes spared my owne familie, and hath yett
$I reserved me, I hope, for his servis: if itt may be
$I also to doe you any, I assure you I shall love my
$I lyfe the better, and be much the more your con_tented,
$I that am
$I Yr most affectionat servant and faithfull freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.
$I More Lodge, this 16th of January [1622-3].
$I To my noble & worthy freind the Lady Cornewallis, att Broome.
