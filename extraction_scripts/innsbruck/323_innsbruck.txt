$I DEARE CORNEWALLIS,
$I THE good nuse of Mr Bacon's amendement was
$I exceeding wellcome to me, that have a lively sence
$I of all that concerns you, in whos discomforts I
$I shall ever have a share, and so have now of glad_nes
$I for the good signes of his recoverie, which lett
$I not your affection make you so distrustfull of,
$I when himselfe, others, and you, too, find a better_inge
$I of his health and strength; for, when nature
$I winnes upon the disease, itt is an argument that
$I the worst is past, though lingering sicknesses
$I are not shaked off att an instant, but commonly
$I weare away by degrees as they camme. Ther_fore
$I have pacience, and afflict not yourselfe; while
$I God, I hope, intends you your harts desier, not
$I to take from you yett that you hold so deare, who
$I have already learnt so well to submit your will to
$I His, as so sharpe a precept needes not to teach
$I you obedience. But, howsoever the only wise God
$I shall please to deale with you, you shall have my
$I infirme prayers that He will never leave to speake
$I peace unto your soule, nor to give you joyefull

<p. 122

$I assurances of His favor, whearof, if it be His will,
$I I beseech Him now, as an earnest, to hear what
$I you aske for your husband; to whom I praye you
$I co(ende me very affectionatly, and tell him, as I
$I did you, that if itt please him to make trial of
$I chandge of ayr, or that remedy which hear grows
$I daylie more and more in request through the gene_ral
$I good successe itt hath, I desier, exsept you
$I will be in London to have him that ministers that,
$I the oftener with him, that he will choose More
$I Park to be the place he will remoove unto, which
$I I hope you both take for one of your homes. But
$I if you had rather be in towne under this roofe,
$I you may commande all I calle mine, which is not
$I farre neither from my cosin Kellway's house, who
$I I dare undertake will be carefull to doe you and
$I Mr Bacon all the servis he can. I give you many
$I thankes for the reseit, which with your last I re_seaved.
$I For all your kindneses I can but love
$I you, which I doe and ever shall hartely while
$I ther is breath in
$I Your most affectionat and faithfull freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.

$I Harington House, in haste, this Saterday morning [1624].
$I Since your goeing my Lo. of Kensington is
$I comme out of France, who brings word that they

<p. 123

$I are so desirous of that mache as I believe itt will
$I presently be both concluded, and she hear, eare
$I long, upon less ill condicions then Spaine insisted
$I on for matter of religion. I intend, God willing,
$I within ten or twelve days at fardest, to be fixed at
$I More Park, from whence I will send to you. My
$I Lo. of Kensington retornes instantly againe into
$I France.
$I To my noble and worthy freind the Lady Cornewallis, att Broome.
