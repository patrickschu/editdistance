$I To my noble Friends, Sir William Spring, Knight and Baronet,
$I      and Maurice Barrow, Esquire: Present these.
$I   GENTLEMEN,                `Cambridge,  September 1643.'
$I   I have been now two days at Cambridge, in ex_pectation
$I to hear the fruit of your endeavours in
$I Suffolk towards the public assistance. Believe it, you
$I will hear of a storm in few days! You have no Infantry
$I at all considerable; hasten your Horses;  a few hours
$I may undo you, neglected.  I beseech you be careful
$I what Captains of Horse you choose, what men be
$I mounted: a few honest men are better than numbers.
$I Some time they must have for exercise. If you choose
$I godly honest men to be Captains of horse, honest
$I men will follow them; and they will be careful to
$I mount such.
$I    The King is exceeding strong in the West. If
$I you be able to foil a force at the first coming of it,
$I you will have reputation; and that is of great advantage
$I in our affairs. God hath given it to our handful; let

<p. 166

$I us endeavour to keep it. I had rather have a plain
$I russet-coated Captain that knows what he fights for, and
$I loves what he knows, than that which you call "a
$I Gentleman" and is nothing else. I honour a Gentleman
$I that is so indeed! 
$I    I understand Mr. Margery hath honest men will
$I follow him: if so, be pleased to make use of him; it
$I much concerns your good to have conscientious men.
$I I understand that there is an Order for me to have
$I 3000l. out of the Association; and Essex hath sent
$I their part, or near it. I assure you we need ex_ceedingly.
$I I hope to find your favour and respect. I
$I protest, if it were for myself, I would not move you.
$I That is all, from
$I             Your faithful servant,
$I                          OLIVER CROMWELL.
$I    P.S. If you send such men as Essex hath sent,
$I it will be to little purpose. Be pleased to take care
$I of their march; and that such may come along with
$I them as will be able to bring them to the main Body;
$I and then I doubt not but we shall keep them, and
$I make good use of them.  I beseech you, give
$I countenance to Mr. Margery! Help him in raising his
$I Troop; let him not want your favour in whatsoever
$I is needful for promoting this work;  and command
$I your servant. If he can raise the horses from
$I Malignants, let him have your warrant: it will be of
$I special service.
