$I   [T]o the moost noble & Worthiest Lordes, moost ryghtful
$I & wysest conseille to owre lige Lorde the Kyng, compleynen, if
$I it lyke to yow, the folk of the Mercerye of London, [as] a
$I membre of the same citee, of many wronges subtiles & also
$I open oppressions, ydo to hem by longe tyme here bifore
$I passed.
$I   Of which oon was where the eleccion of Mairaltee is to be to
$I the fre men of the Citee bi gode & paisible auys of the wysest
$I & trewest at o day in the yere frelich, there nought-withstondyng
$I the same fredam or fraunchise, Nichol Brembre wyth his vpberers
$I purposed hym, the yere next after John Northampton, Mair of
$I the same Citee with stronge honde, as it is ful knowen, &
$I thourgh debate & strenger partye ayeins the pees bifore purueyde
$I was chosen Mair in destruccion of many ryght.
$I   For in the same yere the forsaid Nichol, with-outen nede,
$I aye in the pees made dyuerse enarmynges bi day & eke bi
$I nyght & destruyd the kynges trewe lyges, som with open
$I slaughtre, some bi false emprisonement3, & some fledde the
$I Citee for feere as it is openlich knowen.
$I   And so ferthermore, for to susteyne thise wronges & many
$I othere, the next yere after, the same Nichol, ayeins the forsaide
$I fredam & trewe comunes, did crye openlich that no man
$I sholde come to chese her Mair but such as were sompned, & tho
$I that were sompned, were of his ordynaunce & after his auys.
$I And in the nyght next after folwynge he did carye grete
$I quantitee of Armure to the Guyldehalle, with which as wel
$I straungers of the contree as othere of with-jnne were armed on
$I the morwe, ayeins his owne proclamacion that was such that
$I no man shulde be armed; & certein busshment3 were laide,
$I that, when free men of the Citee come to chese her Mair,
$I breken vp armed cryinge with loude voice 'sle! sle!' folwyng
$I hem; wherthourgh the peple for feere fledde to houses & other
$I [hidy]nges as in londe of werre, adradde to be ded in comune.
$I   And thus yet hiderward hath the Mairaltee ben holden as it
$I were of conquest or maistrye, & many othere offices als. So
$I that what man pryue or apert in special, that he myght wyte,
$I grocchyng pleyned or helde ayeins any of his wronges, or bi

<p. 34

$I puttyng forth of whom so it were, were it neuer so vnpreuable,
$I were apeched, & it were displesyng to hym Nichol, anon was
$I emprisoned. And, though it were ayeins falshede of the leest
$I officer that hym lust meynteigne, was holden vntrewe lige man
$I of owre kyng; for who reproued such an officer, maynteigned
$I bi hym, of wronge or elles, he forfaited ayeins hym, Nichol, & he,
$I vnworthy as he saide, represented the kynges estat. Also if any
$I man bi cause of seruyce or other leueful comaundement approched
$I a lorde, to which lorde he, Nichol, dradde his falshede to be
$I knowe to, anon was apeched that he was false to the conseille
$I of the Citee, & so to the kyng.
$I   And yif in general his falsenesse were ayeinsaide, as of vs
$I togydre of the Mercerye or othere craftes, or ony conseille wolde
$I haue taken to ayeinstande it, or as [tyme] out of mynde hath be
$I vsed, wolden companye togydre, how lawful so it were for owre
$I nede or profite, were anon apeched for arrysers ayeins the pees,
$I & falsly many of vs, that yet stonden endited. And we ben
$I openlich disclaundred, holden vntrewe & traitours to owre Kyng,
$I for the same Nichol sayd bifor Mair, Aldermen, & owre craft
$I bifor hem gadred in place of recorde, that xx. or xxx. of vs
$I were worthy to be drawen & hanged, the which thyng lyke to
$I yowre worthy lordship by an euen Juge to be proued or
$I disproued, the whether that trowthe may shewe, for trouthe
$I amonges vs to fewe or elles no man many day dorst be shewed.
$I And nought oonlich vnshewed or hidde it hath be by man now,
$I but also of bifore tyme the moost profitable poyntes of trewe
$I gouernaunce of the Citee, compiled togidre bi longe labour of
$I discrete & wyse men, wyth-out conseille of trewe men, for thei
$I sholde nought be knowen ne contynued, in the tyme of Nichol
$I Exton, Mair, outerliche were brent.
$I   And so ferforth falsehede hath be vsed that of tyme he,
$I Nichol Brembre, saide in sustenaunce of his falshede owre lige
$I lordes wille was such that neuer was such, as we suppose. He

<p. 35

$I saide also, whan he hadde disclaundred vs, which of us wolde
$I yelde hym false to his kyng, the kyng sholde do hym grace,
$I cherise hym & be good lorde to hym. And if any of vs alle,
$I that wyth goddes help haue & shulle be founden trewe, was so
$I hardy to profre prouyng of hym self trewe, anon was comaunded
$I to prisone as wel bi the Mair that now is as of hym, Nichol
$I Brembre, bifore.
$I   Also we haue be comaunded oft tyme vp owre ligeaunce to
$I vnnedeful & vnleueful dyuerse doynges. And also to wythdrawe
$I vs, bi the same comaundement, fro thynges nedeful & lefful, as
$I was shewed whan a companye of gode women, there men dorst
$I nought, trauailleden barfote to owre lige lorde to seche grace of
$I hym for trewe men as they supposed, for thanne were such
$I proclamacions made that no man ne woman sholde approche
$I owre lige lorde for sechyng of grace, & ouer-many othere
$I comaundement3 also bifore & sithen, bi suggestion and informa_cion
$I of suche that wolde nought her falsnesse had be knowen to
$I owre lige lorde. And lordes, by yowre leue, owre lyge lordes
$I comaundement to symple & vnkonnyng men is a gret thyng to
$I ben vsed so famulerlich with-outen nede, for they, unwyse to
$I saue it, mowe lyghtly ther ayeins forfait.
$I   For thy, graciouse lordes, lyke it to yow to take hede in what
$I manere & where owre lige lordes power hath ben mysused
$I by the forsaid Nichol & his vpberers, for sithen thise wronges
$I bifore saide han ben vsed as accidental or comune braunches
$I outward, it sheweth wel the rote of hem is a ragged subiect or
$I stok inward, that is the forsaid Brere or brembre, the whiche
$I comune wronge vses, & many other, if it lyke to yow, mowe be
$I shewed & wel knowen bi an indifferent Juge and Mair of owre
$I Citee; the which wyth yowre ryghtful lordeship ygraunted for
$I moost pryncipal remedye, as goddes lawe & al resoun wole,
$I that no domesman stonde togidre Juge & partye, wronges sholle
$I more openlich be knowe & trouth dor apere. And ellis, as
$I among vs, we konne nought wyte in what manere without

<p. 36

$I a moch gretter disese, sith the gouernaunce of this Citee
$I standeth as it is bifor saide, & wole stande whil vittaillers bi
$I suffraunce presumen thilke states vpon hem, the which gouer_naunce
$I of, bifor this tyme to moche folke yhidde, sheweth hym
$I self now open whether it hath be a cause or bygynnyng of
$I dyuysion in the Citee & after in the Rewme, or no.
$I   Wherfore for grettest nede as to yow. moost worthy moost
$I ryghtful & wysest lordes and conseille to owre lige lorde the
$I kyng, we biseche mekelich of yowre grac[e] coreccion of alle
$I the wronges bifore sayde, & that it lyke to yowre lordeship
$I to be gracious menes to owre lyge lorde the kyng, that suche
$I wronges be knowen to hym, and that we mowe shewe vs & sith
$I ben holden such trewe [men] to hym as we ben and owe to ben.
$I   Also we biseche vnto yowre gracious lordeship that, if any of
$I vs in special or general be apeched to owre lige lorde or to his
$I worthy conseille bi comunyng with othere or approchyng to
$I owre kyng, as wyth Brembre or his abettours with any wronge
$I wytnesse beryng, as that it stode otherwyse amonges vs here
$I than as it is now proued it hath ystonde, or any other wronge
$I suggestion by which owre lige lorde hath ybe vnleeffullich
$I enfourmed, that thanne yowre worshipful lordship be such that
$I we mowe come in answer to excuse vs. For we knowe wel as for
$I by moche the more partye of vs, and, as we hope, for alle, alle
$I suche wronges han ben vnwytyng to vs or elles outerlich ayeins
$I owre wille. And, ryghtful lordes, for oon the grettest remedye
$I with othere forto ayein-stonde many of thilke diseses afore saide
$I amonges vs, we prayen wyth mekenesse this specialich that the
$I statut ordeigned & made bi parlement holden at westmystre in
$I the sexte yere of owre Kyng now regnynge mowe stonde in
$I strenghte & be execut, as wel here in london as elles where
$I in the rewme, the which is this: Item ordinatum est & statutum
$I quod, etc., etc.
