$I Right Worspll,
$I    The subject of my last letter being so high, & noble
$I a piece of chymistry, viz, the re-individualling of an in_cinerated
$I plant, invites mee once more to request an ex_perimentall
$I eviction of it from your selfe, and I hope you
$I will not chide my Importunity in this petition, or be
$I angry at my so frequent knockings at yr doore to obtaine
$I a grant of so great and admirable a mystery. 'Tis not only
$I an ocular demonstration of our resurrection, but a
$I notable illustration of that Psychopannchy wch Antiquity
$I so generally received, how these Formes of ours may be
$I lulled, and ly asleepe after the separation (closed up in
$I their Ubi's by a surer then Hermes his seale,) untill that
$I great and generall Day, when by the helpe of that gentle
$I heat, wch in six dayes hatch'd the world, by a higher
$I chymistry it shall be resuscitated into its former selfe;

<p. 281

$I suamque Arborem Inversam, in continuo esse, et operari
$I iterata pr‘servabit.
$I    The secret is so noble and admirable, that it has envited
$I my enquiry's into divers Authors and chymicall Tractates,
$I amongst wch Quercitan and Angelus Salae give some little
$I hint thereof, but so obscurely and imperfectly, that I have
$I no more hopes to be ocularly convinced, through their
$I pr‘scriptions, then to be experimentally confirm'd, that
$I the species of an incinerated Animal may be encask'd
$I in a piece of winter chrystall, as some other mineralists
$I confidently affirme. Alsted I confesse in his Pyrotechnia,
$I more cleerely describes the matter but the manner of ex_perimenting
$I it hee utterly leaves unmentioned. Therefore
$I my only addresse is to you, hoping to find as much wil_lingnesse
$I to cmmunicate, as ability to evince the cer_tainty
$I of this secret, to
$I                   The most engaged of yr
$I                         friends,
$I                               Henry Power
$I Ch. Coll. Cambridge

$I Sr,
$I    This enclosed is from a worthy friend of myne, who
$I hath made bold upon my incitement to enwrappe a
$I few lines to you, if you please to repay us both but with
$I one single answer, it will not only evince us of yr faire
$I acceptance of them, but shall also challenge a double
$I Gratulatory as a due debt, in counterpoize and recompence
$I thereof.
$I To the Right Worshippll his honoured Friend Tho.
$I Brown, Dr of Physick in Norwich these
