$I To Mayor Richardson.
$I Gentlemen,
$I    In addition to what we writ you last, you may please to take notice
$I that whereas in your letter to us you say a summe not exceeding 250=li=
$I per annum, it is absolutely necessary that you ascertain in expresse
$I words the summe that is to be raised by pound rent without leaving
$I it so farre indefinite. But if you had once got the consent and sub_scription
$I of all those particular persons who are to contribute after
$I the separation to the maintenance of your ministers (w=ch= can not
$I neither properly be had but to a certain summe) you should then find
$I for the rest that your bill should have as quick a dispatch as you or
$I we can desire. In that matter of ballast we have spoke with the
$I members of severall ports who are sensible of that grieuance & we
$I are deliberating how to proceed therein either by petition to his
$I M=ty= for reversing the Patent or else by a short act for that end.
$I As for the Patent for gaging of wines we think the sooner you send
$I up your charter for that from king James that it may be renewed,
$I the better you will do; & then will be the most naturall time to
$I take notice of that of Palmers. For your foure wine licences by
$I statute of Edward the 6=th= we haue appointed a meeting with
$I M=r=. Recorder before the next Post, & according as we shall upon the
$I discussing of it find you more or lesse concerned, we shall in the bill
$I for confirmation of publick Acts wherein also is that for wine licences,
$I interpose for the preservation of your interest therein. We remaine
$I in some hast
$I                                       Gentlemen
$I                       Your most affectionate friends to serve you
$I                                            Antho Gylby.
$I    Westm: May 20. 1661.
$I    We beseech you be mindfull that the 29=th= of May be kept for
$I a thanksgiving according to the Act in that case.
