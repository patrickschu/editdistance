$I To m=rs= Hoskyns at her
$I house in Widmarshe streete
$I in Heref giue these
$I w=th= speed
$I midle temple
$I    13 Nov: 1601
$I       My very good M=rs= /.
$I I would intreate y=u= to thincke a lyttle vpon the solytary pas_sions
$I of y=r= servaunt./ Yf I fynd not my patience, to be
$I from y=u= six weeks, to grow to greater strength hereafter I
$I must geue over my profession. For I sweare might I
$I dissemble my habit I had rather be in your skullion boys
$I place then where I am: for soe should I be a creature,
$I whereas now I am but a shaddow devided from myne own
$I lyfe & essence. I am lyke an owld pryest that commes to
$I church to reade a chapter and hath lefte his spectacles at
$I home so am I [a second I crossed out] com~e to behold the
$I pracktise of the law and have lefte myne eys [in crossed
$I out] of my mynd in your bosom. O send me those eys that
$I they may tell me how little y=u= remember me, how much
$I gladder y=u= are to be kyndely intreated by som other then by
$I myselfe, and how sorry y=u= are that my returne shall soe
$I soe [sic] soone interrupt y=r= libertye, Let them make relation

$I of y=r= slight regarde of my earnest affecc~on, of y=r= secret
$I smyles at my folly, y=r= setled resolution to feede me w=th=
$I shows, and make a fidlers bridge of my hart, over w=ch= the
$I musique passeth to others eares, but it self hath neyther
$I sence nor share in it.
$I    Let those eys of my mynd w=ch= I left w=th= y=u= com~e and make
$I report to me of som thinge true or false that may be a
$I psuasion to me that it is in vayn for me to loue you, for till
$I then I shall neuer leue louinge over much, w=ch= wilbe but
$I lothsom to y=u= and thancklesse, troblesom to me and endlesse.
$I    But o sweete troble that hast w=th=in these [MS._torn]
$I weekes assured me that the only [MS._torn] absence is
$I gryef w=th=out intermission [MS._torn] proceedes from my

<p. 64

$I imperfecc~on, for y=r= [MS._torn] hath taken order to the
$I contrary: [MS._torn] hath neyther sent letter, nor message,
$I [MS._torn] geuen any demonstration of longinge f[or]
$I me, w=ch= had ben the only fuell to  mayntayn the passions
$I of loue, the only wynd that would fild the sayles of those
$I thoughts w=ch= might loose themselues in an Ocean of sighs,
$I teares, throbs, and tempests, that poore louers endure./
$I but y=r= discretion hath forborn all such occasions, and y=r=
$I silence hath pleaded agaynst my vanity: whoe yf I be asked,
$I why doe y=u= love her soe much I can~ot say so much for
$I myselfe as She would haue me doe soe./ No No fayr, witty
$I and worthy mistresse I haue to longe deceaued myself bycause
$I when I was w=th= y=u= my hart was soe fixed vpon you that I
$I could not looke into myselfe, Now I com~e to pvse my dis_ordred
$I study from that survey I came to behold my dis_tempered
$I selfe; I fynd neyther noblenes nor richesse, nor
$I government, nor knowledge, nor eloquence, nor com~elynesse
$I nor any thinge loue worthy in me, for my welth y=u= may
$I disdayn me for my behaviour y=u= may shun~e me, for my witt
$I y=u= may laughe at me, for my speech y=u= may reprehende me,
$I for my letters y=u= may be weary of me, and for my face y=u=
$I may most iustely hate me, and therefore I am I must be
$I                         y=r= most vnworthy outcast
$I                                J:H
