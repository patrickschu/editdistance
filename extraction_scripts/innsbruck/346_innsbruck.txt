$I TO OUR TRUSTIE AND RIGHT WELL BELOVED
$I THE LADY BACON.
$I HENRIETE MARIE R.
$I RIGHT trustie and right well beloved, we greet
$I you well. Having taken into or particulare care
$I and contemplation the good of your sonne, Sir
$I Frederick, in regard of his matching with one who
$I serves us in a place of such nearnes, wee cannot
$I but be very soary to understand that you are dis_pleased
$I with him for doing that wherby he hath
$I made himself so pleasing and acceptable to us.
$I Hence it is that wee have thought ourselfe tied
$I both in honor and charitie to desire you that you
$I wold not, out of any misconstruction of his pro_ceedings,
$I continue to withdrawe your countenance

<p. 236

$I frome him, but at our intercession vouchafe to look
$I upon him with the eye of a mother; assuring your_self
$I that the gracious intentions which wee carrye
$I towards our servant and his wife shall extend
$I themselfs in so large a measure, both towards him
$I and towards you (if you will make use of them),
$I as at last your owne good nature will acknolledge
$I that your sonne could not have taken a better
$I course, eyther for his owne advancement or for
$I your satisfaction, then that wherein he is for the
$I present. And so much you may beleeve from the
$I mouth of this bearere, one of the gentlemen ushers
$I of our privie chamber, untill you heare it from our
$I owne, which, if you do not frustrat the King's
$I expectation, may be before wee go from hence;
$I till when, and ever, wee committ you to the pro_tection
$I of the Almightie.
$I Given under or hand at Newmarket, this four
$I and twenteth day ofJanuary [1630-31].
