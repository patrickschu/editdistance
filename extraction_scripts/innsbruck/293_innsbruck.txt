$I DEAR MADAM,
$I IT troubled me much that you should thinke me
$I so negligent as not to have written to you againe
$I upon so many sommons as itt semes the mes_senger
$I of your last sayth he gave me: but in my
$I excuse I must first say, the letter was left hear in
$I my absence, and sertainly so hath his caulings
$I binne for an answer, if at all; for I have examined
$I all my servants to whom I thought itt likely he
$I might have addressed himselfe, and neyther I nor
$I they can remember any such matter. Yett per_haps
$I the fault hath not binne his neyther, soe he
$I may well have binne often hear and missed me;
$I for som litle building I have in band att the
$I More, or other busnesses thear, against our goeing
$I theather this sommer, hath for thes many weekes
$I carried me often from hom. Shewr I am neyther
$I want of affection or desier to make all demon_strations
$I therof hath kept my letters from you,
$I which I desier you will believe, and that the long

<p. 44

$I deferring of my promis to vissitt you hath binne
$I inforsed by those occasions I could not avoid; but
$I this sommer I hope to find a tyme more freely
$I mine to dispose of, though I cannot yett name any,
$I being to attend a bargain I am making with my
$I Lo. of Bucklngham's officers for the fee farme of
$I Combe, which will carry me sooner or later thea_ther,
$I as we conclude or breake: but I will first
$I injoine you to give me your word, that you shall
$I not make my coming eyther a troble or a charge
$I for you. This dull towne afords nothing worthy
$I the wrighting, for ther is almost nobody of quality
$I left in itt. Of the Queen's court I can say litle
$I good, for her resolution to part with Roxbrough
$I still continues, which makes her looke big upon
$I all she thinkes loves that good woeman, and they
$I attend her very seldom: of which matter I am one
$I that price her favor, but upon such an occasion
$I cannot be sorry for her frownes, which are now

<p. 45

$I litle to me, all my court busnesses being so dis_patched
$I as they will not much requier my attend_ance
$I ther; and I am growne to love my ease and
$I liberty so well as no measuer of favor could often
$I invite me theather, whear ther is no hope of any
$I good to be donne. My Lo. Mownteagle and my
$I Lo. Chandos are very shortly goeing to the Spaw,
$I though not togethear; for my Lo. Mownteagle is
$I growne so in love with a plentifull fortune and a
$I privat injoyeing therof, as he shuns all other con_versation.
$I When they are gonne ther will scarce
$I be a gentleman to be seen about this towne,
$I whence I shall not stirre till after Midsommer
$I terme. Out of Scotland I hear no newse but that
$I the Inglish of quality are very kindly and royally
$I entertained by the nobility, but the meaner sort
$I not so well used by the common people; which
$I trobles the K. extreamly, who entertains all the
$I noblemen went with him not as servants but
$I guests, This is all his jorney hath yett brought
$I forth. By the next you can send to London by,
$I lett me know when you looke you, that I may not
$I apoint to com to you att an unseasonable tyme;
$I and I beseech you be more confident in my love
$I to you then to suspect the declination therof
$I upon the omission of any seremony, which I con_fesse
$I I am often guilty of towards my freinds,
$I though never willingly of any such neglect as may

<p. 46

$I give them a just cause to suspect me; which you
$I shall never have, but all the proofes in my power
$I that I am as much as you can wishe, or is in me
$I to be to any,
$I Your most faithfull and affectionat freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.
$I I am very glad to hear by Mrs Kendrick that
$I your children are so well. He that hath given
$I them you, give you with them all the comforts
$I children can be to a mother. Lett my best wishes
$I be remembred to Mr Bacon as Imake them for
$I him, and give me leave to entreate you to do
$I me the favor to lett som servant of yours carry the
$I ten peeses I have delivered this bearer to Nor_widge,
$I whence I have had two letters lately from
$I the fine Mr Russell, who itt seems the fayr Queen
$I hath forsaken, for he wrights me word he is ther
$I prisoner, in the under sheriff's house, in great
$I necessity; and it wear a great pitty so compleate
$I a foole should starve, yett I am loth to send on
$I purpose so farre to his worship.
$I Harington House, this 26th of May [1617].
$I To my dear and worthy freind the La. Cornewallis.
