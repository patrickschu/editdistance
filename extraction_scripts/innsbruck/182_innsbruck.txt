$I          To my Cossin Plompton this be delivered.
$I   Cossin Plompton, I hartely recommend me unto you. The
$I cause of my wryting to you is for that Roger Ramy said to me,
$I he thought ye would aboute Low sonday be at Thornhill. Ye
$I shall come to a old howse cleane downe, and as yet litle amended.
$I but ye shall be welcome, as I can think. I wold be sory that
$I ye shoold take paine, and I not at home when ye come. To_morrow
$I begging thursday, I must of force ride to Tankerslay, viij
$I miles hence, and mete my Lord of Shrewsburry, who will be thear
$I tomorrow by ij of the clock, and se a showt at a stage, as my
$I keper hath sent me wourd. And of monday, tewsday, and wed_sday,
$I theare is apoynted a great number of gentlemen to mette at
$I cocxs at Sheifeild, whear I intend, God willing, to be, and every
$I night will ly at Tankerxlay; soe it will be friday or I come to

$I Thornhill, which is the xviij (xiiij) of May. Wherfore, I desire
$I you either put of your comming to that day, or take so much
$I paine to come the viij myles to Tankerxlay, whear I have no
$I lodging, but you shall have the best bed the keper haith; and
$I ye shall se a polard or tow, both rid and falow, and se all our
$I good coxs fight, if it plese you, and se the maner of our
$I cocking. Ther will be Lanckeshire of one parte, and Derbeshire
$I of another parte, and Hallomshire of the third parte. I per_ceive
$I your cocking varieth from ours, for ye lay but the battell;
$I and if our battell be but x=li= to v=li=, thear wilbe x=li= to one laye, or the
$I battell be ended. And whensoever ye come, I require you take
$I time to hunt with me for one weke; bring bowes and gray hounds,
$I and at the time of the year, hownds. A polard is swet now, and I
$I love it best now at this season; and by Whytsonday this year I shall
$I have fatt bucks. And or any red deare be fatt, it will be
$I July, as far as my experience serves. Com when ye will, and such
$I as I have, ye shall se, and bring good stufe, for I warne you they
$I ar wild about Tankerxlay and ill to cach: and if all fale, I have
$I that ar tame enough. I make all these brages to cause you to
$I com, for I never yet did se you in thease parts; and ye shall come
$I no time wrong, fence-time then other. I have tame plenty lyeth
$I out; I can make you game at rid and falow, and stir no rascall. I
$I besich Jesus send us mery meting. Thus hertyly far ye well.
$I This Wendsday at Thornhill, the v=th= of May, Anno 1546: 38 H.8.
$I                              Your asured frind
$I                                     Henry Savill, kn=t=.
