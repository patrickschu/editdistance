$I y conceve to have the grete rule yn this mater, for my lorde Chaun_celler
$I seide, as hit is aboveseid, that he wolde attende when the
$I justyse wolde, the whiche y seide to the justyse. The justyse
$I seyde he wold be aredy at his callyng. And as y conceve by
$I dyvers wordes that they have comyned of a rule yn this mater;
$I what ever hit be y can not wyte as yet. God eve grace hit be

$I and ther was grete bysynes at that tyme, hardly all men were bede
$I to avoyde that chamber saaf the lordes. Nerhtelez y awayted my
$I tyme and put me yn presse and went right to my lorde Chaunceller
$I and seide, "My lorde y am come at youre commaundement, but y
$I se youre grete bysynesse is suche that ye may not attende." He
$I seide, "Noo, by his trauthe and that y myght right well se." Y seide
$I "Yee", and that y was sory and hadde pyty of his grete vexacion."
$I He seide "Mayer, y moste to morun ride by tyme to the Kyng, and
$I come ayen this wyke: ye most awayte apon my comyng, and then y
$I woll speke w=t= the justise and attende for yow, &c," Y seide, "My
$I lorde, y woll do after youre commaundement," and prayed hym of hys
$I gode and gracyous lordship of oo worde more, yf he were enfourmed

<p. 8

$I governed me yn eny wyse at home sithen the last terme my depart_yng
$I fro hym other wyse then to his plesure and after his com_maundement.
$I He seyde right hertly "Nay," but that y hadde
$I governed me at home yn the most best and godely wyse and therfor
$I he oowde me grete thanke, and seide hertely that y sholde have
$I Goddes blessyng and his therfor, &c. And so departed, &c.
