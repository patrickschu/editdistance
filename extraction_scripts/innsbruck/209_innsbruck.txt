$I To my long approued and singular
$I good frende, Master G
$I  Good Master H. I doubt not but you haue some
$I       great important matter in hande, which al this while
$I       restraineth youre Penne, and wonted readinesse in
$I       prouoking me vnto that, wherein your selfe nowe
$I       faulte. If there bee any such thing in hatching,
$I       I pray you hartily, lette vs knowe, before al the
$I       worlde see it. But if happly you dwell altogither in
$I Iustinians Courte, and giue your selfe to be deuoured of secreate Studies,
$I as of all likelyhood you doe: yet at least imparte some your olde, or newe,
$I Latine, or Englishe, Eloquent and Gallant Poesies to vs, from whose eyes,
$I you saye you keepe in a manner nothing hidden. Little newes is here
$I stirred: but that olde greate matter still depending. His Honoure neuer
$I better. I thinke the Earthquake was also there wyth you (which I would
$I gladly learne) as it was here with vs: ouerthrowing diuers old buildings,
$I and peeces of Churches. Sure verye straunge to be hearde of in these
$I Countries, and yet I heare some saye (I know not howe truely) that they
$I haue knowne the like before in their dayes. Sed quid vobis videtur magnis
$I Philosophis? I like your late Englishe Hexameters so exceedingly well,

<p. 16

$I that I also enure my Penne sometime in that kinde: whyche I fynd indeede,
$I as I haue heard you often defende in worde, neither so harde, nor so
$I harshe, that it will easily and fairely, yeelde it selfe to oure Moother
$I tongue. For the onely, or chiefest hardnesse, whych seemeth, is in the
$I Accente: whyche sometime gapeth, and as it were yawneth ilfauouredly,
$I comming shorte of that it should, and sometime exceeding the measure
$I of the Number, as in Carpenter, the middle sillable being vsed shorte in
$I speache, when it shall be read long in Verse, seemeth like a lame Gosling,
$I that draweth one legge after hir: and Heauen, beeing vsed shorte as one
$I sillable, when it is in Verse, stretched out with a Diastole, is like a lame
$I Dogge that holdes up one legge. But it is to be wonne with Custome,
$I and rough words must be subdued with Vse. For, why a Gods name may
$I not we, as else the Greekes, haue the kingdome of oure owne Language,
$I and measure our Accentes, by the sounde, reseruing the Quantitie to the
$I Verse? Loe here I let you see my old vse of toying in rymes, turned
$I into your artificial straightnesse of Verse, by this Tetrasticon. I beseech
$I you tell me your fancie, without parcialitie.
$I   See yee the blindefoulded pretie God, that feathered Archer,
$I    Of Louers Miseries which maketh his bloodie Game?
$I   Wote ye why, his Moother with a Veale hath coouered his Face?
$I    Trust me, least he my Looue happely chaunce to beholde.
$I Seeme they comparable to those two, which I translated you ex tempore
$I in bed, the last time we lay togither in Westminster?
$I   That which I eate, did I ioy, and that which I greedily gorged,
$I    As for those many goodly matters leaft I for others.
$I   I would hartily wish, you would either send me the Rules and Precepts
$I of Arte, which you obserue in Quantities, or else followe mine, that
$I M. Philip Sidney gaue me, being the very same which M. Drant deuised,
$I but enlarged with M. Sidneys own iudgement, and augmented with my
$I Obseruations, that we might both accorde and agree in one: leaste we
$I ouerthrowe one an other, and be ouerthrown of the rest. Truste me, you
$I will hardly beleeue what greate good liking and estimation Maister Dyer

<p. 17

$I had of youre Satyricall Verses, and I, since the viewe thereof, hauing
$I before of my selfe had speciall liking of Englishe Versifying, am euen
$I nowe aboute to giue you some token, what, and howe well therein I am
$I able to doe: for to tell you trueth, I minde shortely at conuenient leysure,
$I to sette forth a Booke in this kinde, whyche I entitle, Epithalamion
$I Thamesis, whyche Booke I dare vndertake wil be very profitable for the
$I knowledge, and rare for the Inuention, and manner of handling. For in
$I setting forth the marriage of the Thames: I shewe his first beginning,
$I and offspring, and all the Countrey, that he passeth thorough, and also
$I describe all the Riuers throughout Englande, whyche came to this Wed_ding,
$I and their righte names, and right passage, etc. A worke beleeue
$I me, of much labour, wherein notwithstanding Master Holinshed hath
$I muche furthered and aduantaged me, who therein hath bestowed singular
$I paines, in searching oute their firste heades, and sourses: and also in
$I tracing, and dogging oute all their Course, til they fall into the Sea.
$I                  O Tite, siquid, ego,
$I                  Ecquid erit pretij?
$I   But of that more hereafter. Nowe, my Dreames, and dying Pellicane,
$I being fully finished (as I partelye signified in my laste Letters) and pre_sentlye
$I to bee imprinted, I wil in hand forthwith with my Faery Queene,
$I whyche I praye you hartily send me with al expedition: and your frendly
$I Letters, and long expected Iudgement wythal, whyche let not be shorte,
$I but in all pointes suche, as you ordinarilye vse, and I extraordinarily
$I desire. Multum vale. Westminster. Quarto Nonas Aprilis 1580. Sed,
$I amabò te, Meum Corculum tibi se ex animo commendat plurimùm: iamdiu
$I mirata, te nihil ad literas suas responsi dedisse. Vide quaeso, ne id tibi
$I Capitale sit: Mihi certè qidem erit, nwque tibi hercle impunè, vt opinor,
$I Iterum vale, et quàm voles saepè.
$I                                    Yours alwayes to commaunde
$I                                              IMMERITO.
