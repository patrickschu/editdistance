$I DEARE MADAM,
$I I TAKE extreme kindly your sending to visit
$I mee, which I should not have delayed an ower
$I thanking you for, but that itt is so busy a tyme
$I heare, both about what consernes the publicke
$I and my owne privat, as I have, against my will,
$I binne hindered from dispatching your man accord_ing
$I to my desier and purpos; but the assurance he
$I carries of my present health I know will make you
$I excuse the length of his staye. My feare of re_lapsing
$I makes me content to punish myselfe this
$I spring by following a course of phisicke Sir Theo_dor
$I Mayerne hath putt mee into, though I am
$I very incredulous that itt can prevent my having
$I more fitts of the goute; howsoever, when I am
$I trobled with any, they are accompanied with such
$I accidents of sicknes as shows they proseed from
$I such humors as phisicke uses to correct, against
$I which I have too rebellious a spleene I doubt to
$I be brought into such obedience as not faster to

<p. 146

$I power out the souernes therof into my stomache,
$I and distill itt into other parts, then all the potica_rie's
$I drugs will be able to correct. What I do,
$I therfore, is rather because itt shall not be layd to
$I my charge that I neglect the meanes of health,
$I then out of any great hope of cure by itt, which
$I weather I have or no, God, I trust, will give mee
$I thankfulnes to Him and patience till His apointed
$I tyme of releasing mee from all misserie; of which
$I wee are yett like to have in generall more and
$I more, if this Parlement and the King part not
$I upon better termes then yett they stand, the King
$I having declared himselfe stiffe one way, and they
$I growing stronger and stronger in their resolucions
$I another. They have had som way given them,
$I which is understood by them as a good signe of
$I the King's relenting, who may, if he please, have
$I of them what none of his predecessors ever had of
$I their people, so they may with all have their bar_gaine,
$I without which they thinke all their liberal_ity
$I would be no better then cast away: what the
$I event will be, a fewe dayes more will show. In
$I the mean tyme my Lo. Marshall remains att the

<p. 147

$I Tower, though my Lo. Chamberlain is laboring to
$I gett his prison changed to his owne house at
$I Highgate. I wishe another time had binne taken
$I for that hasty busynes, in regard of the want of so
$I able a man at this tyme in the upper house, whea_ther
$I ther is no probability he will be suffered to
$I com this secion though he wear enlarged. All
$I other kind of nuse for the present lies dead hear,
$I exsept itt have some relacion to the Parlement,
$I and my ower of persecucion is com; therfore,
$I deare Lady, farwell. Lett your love to me, and
$I confidence in myne to you, continue alike; for,
$I truste me, the one is highly valued, and to lessen
$I the other you shall never have just cause given
$I you by
$I Your most affectionat, faithfull freind and
$I servant,                                L. BEDFORD.
$I Believe mee, your son Fred. hath my prayers
$I that he may be so blessed from heaven as that
$I your comfort in him may daylie increase. With
$I many thankes to Sr Nathaniel Bacon, do mee the
$I favor to retorne my best salutacions, to whom I
$I was extreme sorry I could not, at his being heare,
$I do those litle servises I ought to your husband,

<p. 148

$I and my respect of himselfe; but itt was so late be_fore
$I I knew att all of his being in the list of the
$I Knights of the Bath, after which I inquired not,
$I and so lived in ignorance till his owne coming to
$I me, as on that alone I can charge my ill hap.
$I St Jeames's Streete, this last of March [1626].
$I I cannot close my letter without being a begger
$I to you to helpe me, if you can, to another good
$I and fine tumbler, being a comodity not to be got_ten
$I in thes parts. Thus, you see, I cannot leave
$I my custum of robbing you.
$I To my noble and deare freind the Lady Bacon, att Broome.
