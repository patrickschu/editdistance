$I Dear Savile,
$I    Do a charity becoming one of your pious principles, in preserv_ing
$I your humble servant Rochester from the imminent peril of
$I sobriety, which, for want of good wine more than company (for
$I I drink like a hermit betwixt God and my own conscience) is
$I very like to befall me. Remember what pains I have formerly
$I taken to wean you from your pernicious resolutions of dis_cretion

<p. 92

$I and wisdom. And, if you have a grateful heart (which is
$I a miracle amongst you statesmen), show it by directing the
$I bearer to the best wine in town, and pray let not this highest
$I point of sacred friendship be performed slightly, but go about it
$I with all due deliberation and care, as holy priests to sacrifice, or
$I as discreet thieves to the wary performance of burglary and
$I shop-lifting. Let your well-discerning palate (the best judge
$I about you) travel from cellar to cellar and then from piece to
$I piece till it has lighted on wine fit for its noble choice and my
$I approbation. To engage you the more in this matter, know, I
$I have laid a plot may very probably betray you to the drinking
$I of it. My Lord  will inform you at large.
$I    Dear Savile, as ever thou dost hope to out-do Machiavel or
$I equal me, send some good wine! So may thy wearied soul at
$I last find rest, no longer hovering 'twixt th' unequal choice of
$I politics and lewdness! May'st thou be admired and loved for
$I thy domestic wit; beloved and cherished for thy foreign interest
$I and intelligence.
$I                          Rochester.
