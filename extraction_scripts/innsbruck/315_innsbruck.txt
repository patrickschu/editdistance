$I DEAR MADAM,—I am extream sorry to hear you
$I have binne so ill, but with as much gladnes thank
$I God for your good recovery, whos health and hap_pines
$I is not more hartely wished by any freind
$I you have in the world; nor indeed can any be more
$I engaged to desier all good to you, since your con_stant
$I affection to me challenges all the thanke_full
$I retornes an indebted freind sensible of such
$I kindnes can make, which though I confes my_selfe
$I in expressing seremoniously, yet I will never
$I be found gilty of neglecting any real proofes I

<p. 78

$I may give therof when eyther you or my good
$I fortune may calle me to do so. I have myselfe
$I had an unhealthfull spring of this, which I hope
$I will not end in a lame leg, and that of that too I
$I shall not long have cause to complaine. The
$I greatest nuse I can send from hence is, that this
$I day my Lo. of Arundel is co(itted to the Tower
$I by the Upper House of Parlement for refusing
$I tomake a submission to the House, and give satis_faction
$I according to the order of the House, for
$I som reprochefull speaches he had ther used to my
$I Lo. Spencer; in which, nor his refusal to make
$I a fitting reparacion, he hath not played the part of
$I so wise a man as for his noble Ladie's sake I wish
$I he had. Sir Robert Chichester's scurvie dealing

<p. 79

$I hath broken up the match betwixt his daughter
$I and my Lo. of Arran, which drives me to play
$I my game another way than I had layed my cards,
$I and will hold me a Londoner till the ende of the
$I next terme; before which you shall hear from
$I me againe; and I am not unmindful of what any
$I way I owe you, which is more than can be re_quited
$I by your trewly loveing friend,
$I L. BEDFORD.

$I Doe me the favor to recōmend me affectionatly
$I to Mr Bacon, and thanke him for his kind re_membering
$I me. Sir Thomas Fraser, our oulde
$I fellow, is eyther dead, or cannot passe this night,
$I of an imposthume, the fisicians conclude, in the
$I mesentery.

$I Harington House, this 17th of May [1621].
$I To my worthy freind the Lady Cornewallis.
