<Oliver Cromwell to the Mayor of Newcastle (1656),

$I To the Mayor of Newcastle: To be communicated to the
$I      Aldermen and others whom it doth concern.
$I                Whitehall, 18th December, 1656.
$I         Gentlemen, and my very good friends,
$I    My Lord Strickland, who is one of our Council,
$I did impart to us a Letter written from yourselves to

<p. 2

$I him, according to your desire therein expressed; which
$I occasions this return from us to you.
$I    As nothing that may reflect to the prejudice of
$I your outward Good, either Personal, or as you are a
$I Civil Government, shall easily pass with us; so, much
$I less what shall tend to your discouragement, as you
$I are Saints, to your Congregations, gathered in that
$I way of fellowship commonly known by the name of
$I Independents, whether of one judgment or other: 
$I `this' shall be far from being actually discountenanced,
$I or passively `left to' suffer damage, by any applying
$I themselves to me. I do, once for all, give you to
$I understand that I should thereby destroy and dis_appoint
$I one of the main ends for which God hath
$I planted me in the station I am in.
$I    Wherefore I desire you in that matter to rest se_cure.
$I True it is that two Ministers, one Mr. Cole and
$I one Mr. Pye, did present to me a Letter in the name
$I of divers Ministers of Newcastle, the Bishoprick of
$I Durham and Northumberland; of an honest and Chris_tian
$I purpose: the sum whereof I extracted, and re_turned
$I an answer thereunto;  a true Copy whereof
$I I send you here enclosed. By which I think it will
$I easily appear, that the consideration of my kindness is
$I well deserved by them; provided they observe the con_dition
$I `there' expressed; which in charity I am bound
$I to believe they will; and without which their own
$I consciences and the world will know how to judge of
$I them.
$I    Having said this, I, or rather the Lord, require of
$I you, that you walk in all peaceableness and gentle_ness,
$I inoffensiveness, truth and love towards them, as
$I becomes the Servants and Churches of Christ. Know_ing

<p. 3

$I well that Jesus Christ, of whose diocese both they
$I and you are, expects it. Who, when He comes to
$I gather His People, and to make Himself "a name and
$I "praise amongst all the people of the earth,"  He
$I "will save her that halteth, and gather her that was
$I "driven out, and will get them praise and fame in
$I "every land, where they have been put to shame."
$I And such "lame ones" and "driven-out ones" were
$I not the Independents only, and Presbyterians, a few
$I years since, by the Popish and Prelatical Party in
$I these Nations; but such are and have been the Pro_testants
$I in all lands,  persecuted, and faring alike
$I with you, in all the Reformed Churches. And there_fore,
$I knowing your charity, to be as large as all the
$I Flock of Christ who are of the same Hope and Faith
$I of the Gospel with you; I thought fit to commend
$I these few words to you;  being well assured it is
$I written in your heart, So to do with this that I shall
$I stand by you in the maintaining of all your just privi_leges
$I to the uttermost.
$I    And committing you to the blessing of the Lord,
$I I rest
$I                        Your loving friend,
$I                           Oliver P. 
