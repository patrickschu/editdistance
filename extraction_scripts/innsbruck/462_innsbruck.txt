$I London, 5th june, 1688.
$I DEAR SIR,
$I    Saturday night last I returned hither from the West,
$I and found my wife and children well here. I was with your
$I cousin Stratton at Sutton Court, and at his own house about a
$I fortnight since, but could not be so serviceable to you there as
$I I designed by reason he had not, nor could not possibly (as he
$I said) make out your accompt for me, but promised to return
$I fifty pounds of your money hither to me with the first oppor_tunity,
$I and make his accounts perfect agianst my coming again
$I into that country. There are generally great complaints of
$I the difficulties to raise money amongst tenants, but I meet with
$I none greater than those I have heard from Mr. Stratton, the
$I tenants thereabouts being much worse than formerly, and (as
$I he says) are grown so poor and scarce that unless they are per_mitted
$I to have their rents left in their hands for a considerable
$I time, and other advantages besides, there is not a tenant to be
$I had for anything in these parts. By all which I presume there
$I are some arrears greater than he was willing to tell me the
$I particulars of at that time, especially having a prospect that the
$I greatest part of them will be speedily gotten in. Mr. Stratton
$I hath followed the method I directed, and without any difficulty
$I and trouble hath got into his hands your lease to Robert Haroll
$I of the home-close at Beluton, etc, which will be a further
$I security for what remains due from him to ... prevent him in
$I his design of making such unreasonable advantages upon you
$I as he intended by it.
$I    My time at present will not permit me to give you a more
$I particular account of your affairs in Somerset, but if I can be

<p. 275

$I so happy as to see you this summer, as I intended, you will
$I then be more fully informed, but ever since I fixed my thoughts
$I of that enjoyment, everything has seemed to conspire against me
$I in it. First many cross accidents in my own affairs have hap_pened
$I besides the death of my Lady King, which brought me
$I into a trust for her children. And immediately upon that the
$I sickness and death of my Cousin Clarke's lady here, he being at
$I that time extremely ill, and since dead in the country leaving
$I the care of his estate and four young children upon me, hath so
$I much increased my affairs and troubles that at present I can
$I hardly see a way through them. But notwithstanding these
$I and many other unexpected misfortunes that have happened,
$I yet Madam and I are not totally without hopes of seeing you
$I before we return into the West, if there be a possibility of my
$I getting so much time as to come to you, which I most earnestly
$I and heartily wish for.
$I your friend Mrs. R.S. is just now come in with your letter
$I that came enclosed the last week to her for me, and gives you
$I her real love and service, but at present the time will not permit
$I me to answer any part of it. But you may be certain I will
$I carefully perform what is therein desired, and answer it with the
$I first opportunity, and for ever remain,
$I      your most affectionate friend and faithful servant,
$I                           E....
$I Madam gives her service to you, etc.
$I [Add.]: For Mr. Locke, These.
