$I    WHEREAS we have been enforced, by apparent
$I grounds of approaching danger, to begin to fortify the
$I Town of Cambridge, for preventing the Enemy's in_road,
$I and the better to maintain the peace of this
$I County:
$I    Having in part seen your good affections to the

<p. 129

$I Cause, and now standing in need of your further assist_ance
$I to the perfecting of the said Fortifications, which
$I will cost at least Two-thousand pounds, We are en_couraged
$I as well as necessitated to desire a Freewill
$I Offering of a Liberal Contribution from you, for the
$I better enabling of us to attain our desired ends,  viz.
$I the Preservation of our County;  knowing that every
$I honest and well-affected man, considering the vast
$I ex_penses we have already been at, and our willingness to
$I do according to our ability, will be ready to contribute
$I his best assistance to a work of so high concernment
$I and so good an end.
$I    We do therefore desire that what shall be by you
$I freely given and collected may with all convenient speed
$I be sent to the Commissioners at Cambridge, to be em_ployed
$I to the use aforesaid. And so you shall further
$I engage us to be
$I                    Yours ready to serve,
$I                        OLIVER CROMWELL.
$I                        THOMAS MARTYN. 
$I                        ('and Six others.')
