$I For my LADY BERKELEY.
$I Dover Street, London.
$I PETWORTH. Sept. 7, 14, 1698.
$I We are got hither at last, and Papa I thank God
$I very well, and so insufferably pert with winning 12
$I guineas at Crimp last night. The Duke of Somersett
$I says he never remembers seeing him better. We came
$I a Monday in the evening and just before the Duchess
$I had a letter from La. Scarborough to tell her she went to
$I London today for a fortnight, and intended to se me
$I at Moore Park as she went by, soe your charm is not yet
$I ended wh. hindered us from meeting two summers, but
$I I had a letter yesterday from her to desire that it may
$I be when the Duchess of Somerset comes to stay there
$I a fortnight, wh. is to be as soon as she returns from
$I London and while the Duke goes to Marlborough. When
$I she is there pray enquire a great deal of our East India
$I ships with wh. she is concerned as well as I, and nobodye
$I can inform you better of what I most desire to know is
$I whether I may take part of my share in what I like or
$I must be obliged to have it all in money if tis divided wch
$I wether it be much or little to me would make a great
$I difference. And now I must tell you what misfortunes
$I have hear befalled some of your friends and mine. My
$I Ld. Portland and Monsr. Overkerke I hear have had a
$I quarrell at Loo, and the last they say treated him like a
$I dog which I am apt enough to believe, for people are too
$I apt to insult when one is falling and when nobody will
$I helpe to right one. I believe one has seldom the heart
$I to do anything towards itt themselves, this they say has
$I extremely exalted another person, and altogether tis
$I thought more than my Ld. Portland can beare altogether
$I any longer, that he may not want a companion in his

$I afternoons, I heare that Mrs. Howard came t'other day
$I from ... where Mrs. Billingsly had order to take ye care
$I the children from her and when she came to my Lord of
$I Essex' lodgings at London, she found a padlock. Upon
$I that she could not get in wch Mr. Billingsly said he had
$I my Lord Essex's order for. You know whether I am
$I rightly informed in all this, and pray send a yd of muslin
$I for pinners and ten yards of crowsfoot to edge it with
$I to Mrs. Hanbury before you leave towne, the Dke. and
$I Dchess. of Richmond dine here to-day and soe my newes
$I and my letter are at an end together.
$I Adieu I desire you will send word to East Sheene
$I what is become of it, there is now noe doubt of our being
$I home to receive our letters on Friday.
$I You never told me what became of ...
