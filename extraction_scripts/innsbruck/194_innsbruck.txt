$I MADAM
$I Although we heare that since the death of your
$I husband, our late Ambassador, S=r= Thomas Hoby, you
$I have received, in France, great and comfortable cour_tesyes
$I from the French King, the Queen Mother, the
$I Queen of Navarre and sundry others, yet we made ac_compt
$I that all these layd together cannot so satisfye
$I you as some testimony and sparke of our favour, with
$I the application of the late service of your Husband,
$I and of your own demeanour there: wherefore though
$I you shall receive it somewhat lately in time, yet we as_sure
$I you the same proceedeth only of the late know_ledge
$I of your return. And therefore we let you know
$I that the service of your Husband was to us so accept_able,
$I as next yourself and your children we have not

<p. 230

$I the meanest loss of so able a Servant in that calling.
$I And yet since it hath so pleased God to call him in
$I the entry of this our Service, we take it in the better
$I part, seeing it hath appeared to be Gods pleasure to
$I call him away, so favourably to the service of him, es_pecially
$I in the constancy of his duty towards God,
$I wherein, we hear say, he dyed very commendably.
$I And for your self, we cannot but let you know that
$I we hear out of France such singular good reports of
$I your duty well accomplished towards your husband,
$I both living and dead, with other your sober, wise, and
$I discreet behaviour in that Court and Country, that we
$I think it a part of great contentation to us, and com_mendation
$I of our Country, that such a Gentlewoman
$I hath given so manifest a testimony of virtue in such
$I hard times of adversity. And therefore though we
$I thought very well of you before, yet shall we hereafter
$I make a more assured account of your virtues and gifts,
$I and wherein soever we may conveniently do you plea_sure,
$I you may be thereof assured. And so we would
$I have you to rest yourself in quietness, with a firm opi_nion
$I of our especiall favour towards you. Given un_der
$I our Signet at our City of Oxford the . . of Sep_tember
$I 1566 : the eight year of our Reign.
$I Your loving Friend
$I ELIZABETH  R.
