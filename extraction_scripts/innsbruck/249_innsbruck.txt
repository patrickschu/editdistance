$I    Most Noble
$I             Earle:
$I      Neither am I or my cause so much unknowne to youre
$I Lordshipp, as it should driue mee to seeke a second meanes, or
$I dispaire of this to youre fauoure. You haue euer been free and
$I Noble to mee, and I doubt not the same proportion of youre
$I Bounties, if I can but answere it with preseruation of my vertue,

<p. 200

$I and Innocence, when I faile of those, let me not onlye be
$I abandon'd of you, but of Men. the Anger of the Kinge is death
$I (saith the wise man) and in truth it is little lesse with mee and my
$I frend, for it hath buried vs quick. And though we know it onelie
$I the propertie of men guiltie, and worthy of punishment to inuoke
$I Mercye; yet now it might relieue vs, who haue onlie our Fortunes
$I made our fault: and are indeede vexed for other mens licence.
$I Most honor'd Earle, be hastie to our succoure. And, it shall be
$I our care and studye, not to haue you repent the tymely benefit you
$I do vs; which we will euer gratefullye receiue and Multiplye in our
$I acknowledgment.
$I                                     Ben: Johnson.
