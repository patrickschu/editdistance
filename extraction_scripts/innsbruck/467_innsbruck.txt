$I Friday Night.
$I My head and heart is too full to be able to express
$I what I feel for you and my selfe upon this great blow to
$I our family yet I cant let this messenger return without
$I assuring you that you have no friend bears a greater share
$I with you, wch I am doubly concerned in both for your
$I sake and my own. I beg of God Almighty to support you
$I and my Father under it and that you would not neglect
$I yourselves since it cannot at all be of any advantage to
$I those we have lost and will be much the contrary to them
$I that are left behind. If my Father cannot prevail with
$I you to remove from that dismal place I will certainly see
$I you there the beginning of next week in the mean time
$I all you desired shall be speedily done. And I can't end
$I without making it my request that you should for my sake
$I take some care of yourselfe and let not y=r= trouble overcome
$I you, which I am afraid it will do if you don't strive against
$I it. I beg to have my humble duty presented to my Father
$I whose affliction I am most heartily concerned for. I
$I would myselfe have writt to him but that two such letters
$I are not to be writt, I mightily desire that I may hear how
$I you and your Father do and dear (Ant ?) remember your_selfe 
$I in thinking how many kind friends you have left
$I which I am sure deserve your care, and some return for
$I there concern for you. I wish I had gone down now with
$I my Father but next week if it please God somewhere I
$I will see you till when I shall not be easy. Adieu.
