$I   Sir:I most humbly thank you for your letters.
$I I cannot tell what to think of my brother Stafford's
$I advertisement; for if it be true that the King of
$I Spain's forces be dissolved, I would not wish the
$I Queen's Majesty to be at this charges that she is
$I at; but if it be but a device, knowing that a little
$I thing maketh  us too careless, then I know not what
$I may come of it. But this I am sure of ; if her
$I Majesty would have spent but a 1,000 crowns to
$I have had some intelligence, it would have saved
$I her twenty times as much. Assure yourself he
$I knoweth what we do here; and if the army be or
$I do dissolve, it is the preparation that her Majesty

<p. 47

$I hath made that is the cause; for he cannot abide
$I this heat that is provided for him. He did never
$I think that he would thus have provided for his
$I coming, but that the number of false alarums that
$I he hath given her Majesty would have made her to
$I have taken no alarum, and so to have had the
$I vantage; and the chopping up of his friends here I
$I am sure he doth not like; and if they be up, I wish
$I they should continue so till there be a good peace,
$I which I pray to God to send us.
$I   Sir, if your next advertisements do assure the
$I dissolving of the army in Spain, then it were good
$I we did so here; yet if the Duke of Parma continue
$I his, and that there be any doubt of anything
$I intended for Scotland, put but three or four more
$I ships to them in the Narrow Seas and I dare assure
$I you it shall beat any power he shall be able to make,
$I and impeach him of any attempt in Scotland; and
$I I will take upon me the service myself; for I assure
$I you it doth grieve me to see her majesty at more
$I charges than is needful, and this charge will not be
$I great. I would fain keep the Narrow Seas three
$I or four months; I persuade myself I shall do some
$I service.
$I   Upon your next advertisement, as the cause upon
$I that shall require, I will write to you, Sir, my good
$I friend, my opinion, and then you may use it as you
$I shall think best. And so I pray you to write me
$I frankly; for I do assure you I will take it kindly
$I and friendly at your hands, and think myself much
$I beholden unto you for it; for I may sometimes,
$I upon a good conceit in my opinion, make such a
$I journey as I did now to Harwich; and yet it may
$I not be so well taken there; but I know no cause

<p. 48

$I why it should be but well taken. I do assure you,
$I on my honour, it cost not the Queen's Majesty one
$I halfpenny, nor shall not, when I make any such
$I journey. I will rather spend myself one hundred
$I pounds than to spend her one penny. Thus, good
$I Mr. Secretary I am bold with you, as my special
$I good friend; and so bid you most heartily farewell,
$I and God send you health and strength. From the
$I Bear, the 24th of January.
$I                 Your assured loving friend to use,
$I                                         C. Howard.
