$I   Mary Queen-Dowager of France to Wolsey.
$I                        A.D. 1515.
$I My very good lord,
$I   With all my heart I commend me unto you. I
$I understand that it hath pleased the king my brother
$I to promote doctor West, being here one of his
$I ambassadors, to the bishoprick of Ely, whereof I
$I am right glad. By reason of which promotion he
$I must depart with divers of his benefices, among
$I which he hath two, one called Egglesfield, in the
$I bishopric of Durham, and the other the archdaeconry
$I of Derby, which (as I am informed) be of no great
$I value. Beseeching you, my lord, at mine instance,
$I and for my sake, to be so good lord unto my ser_vant
$I John Palgrave, master of art, which hath done
$I unto me right good and acceptable service, to his
$I and his friends' great charge, and on my part as yet
$I hitherto unremembered, as by your good wisdom
$I and provision to find the means that he may have
$I one of the said benefices. Heartily praying you and
$I trusting that you will do it with effect, and to re_scribe
$I unto me your good will done therein. And
$I thus the Holy Ghost preserve you.
$I   From Paris, the third day of April.
$I                            MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE.
$I   To my lord of York.
