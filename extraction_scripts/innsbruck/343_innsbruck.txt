$I GOOD MADAM,
$I HAVINGE lately received letters from Sir Thomas
$I Meautys touchinge his little sonne, that eyther yor
$I Lap will take him into yor care, or els that he be

<p. 229

$I sent over to him, as also that a some of 8li of his,
$I wch feil out to remaine in Mr Longe's handes &
$I was kept for the vse of the nurse, shold be deliuer_ed
$I to this bearer, his sergeaunt, I haue thought itt
$I my parte, in discharge of that that I do and haue
$I vndertaken for the childe, to move yor Lap yt you
$I wold please (if itt may stand wth yor lykeinge) to
$I take the childe to yor custody, or if there be, as
$I padventure there may be, some raason why you
$I shold not, then to give yor advice what shalbe
$I done wth itt, for I will haue no hande in sendinge
$I itt to sea, where I dare not goe my self; and that
$I whereas about Michellmas last yor Lap sent me 5li
$I to provide for him wthall, I haue layde out aboue
$I half of itt for clothes for him, & made accounte
$I to laye oute that 8li of his father's about the childe,
$I wch he now sends for to be deliuered to his ser-_geaunt,
$I & I haue accordingly lett him haue 3li,
$I wch is all that is left either of yor Lap’s 5li or his 8li,
$I & so you may perceive I am a bare boorde, wherof
$I I   thought fytt to acquainte yor Lap that such further
$I order may be taken as you shall thinke meete.
$I And thus, wth myne & Mr Longe's our hartye
$I thankes to yor Lap for yor remembraunce of vs, and
$I myne moste prticuler for the gloues yor Lap sent
$I me, I take my leave. Yor Lap’s to comannde,
$I          BRIDGETT LONGE.
$I 2 April 1630.
$I To the very worthy lady, her very good freinde,
$I the Lady Bacon, theis.
