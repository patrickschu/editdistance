$I MY DEARE FRIEND,-I am more afflicted then I could
$I have imagined anything in the world could have maide
$I me after the recovry of a very troublesome and painful
$I indisposition, but now that the violence of that is abated
$I you involve me in a more insupportable trouble then any
$I I ever felt by the despaire you putt me in of a happynesse
$I I thought myselfe sure of and instead of using that free_dome
$I with me that I have ever practised in all my con_cerns 
$I towards you, you now begin to put me with un_friendly 
$I excuses by telling me that though you doe not
$I thinke Mrs. (Joist ?) the wisest woman in her country yett
$I you thinke she has not deserved such an enemy as G. O.
$I that person is so inconsiderable to me when any insinua_tions 
$I of this come in ballance with the affection I have
$I for you as nothing in the world would be of lesse waite
$I but I assure you upon my word that I am sertin they
$I never have as they have not to me, sayed any suche thing
$I to any body, and if this is not a cruell deniall that you
$I have made to put me of it is the greatest piece of mallis
$I in your Informer to G. O. that ever I heard of for to my
$I knolidg they doe not speak better of any person then they
$I have done before me of your friend and G. O. has a very
$I perticular respecte for her but had they the greatest aver_sion 
$I to her imaginable nothing of this should daterre me
$I from pressing the same request with as much heate as
$I ever besides I am soe free as to the power of giving that
$I person all the welcome that they can expect as due to
$I theare meritt that I am very indifferent wheather G. O.
$I be satisfied with my choyce or no since I am sure the
$I only body that I am obliged by duty or inclination to
$I consider is very extremely well pleased with the Caviller
$I I have maide him of I thinke the worthyist woman in the
$I world and to her I bend all my desier and my hopes are
$I fixed upon her constance to welcome without reluctance
$I the promisse you maide so muche in favour of-YOURS.
$I June 17, 1664.

<p. 10

$I I have a greate many Baux at her service whos com_pany 
$I I desiere, informe yourselfe and send me word when
$I my choch shall meet her.
$I My humble service to your sister the country now is
$I soe pleasant that though my Lord is at London and this
$I place is solitary enuff, yett I will sweare I never in my
$I life parst my time with more sollid satisfaction, pray answer
$I this as soon as possibly you can for I am impatient to
$I heare the success of yis bill. Farewell, my deare Friend.
