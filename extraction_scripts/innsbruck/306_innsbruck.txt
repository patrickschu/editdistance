$I DEAR CORNEWALLIS,
$I I SEND this bearer to inquire of my sicke freinds,
$I into which number I am extream sorry to hear
$I Mr Bacon is fallen, both for his own sake
$I and yours, and as desirous as any can be to hear of
$I his amendement, which I hartely pray for, and
$I hope to reseave the good newse of att this mes_senger's
$I retorne. I heard not of his being ill till
$I my Lo. Chamberlain told me of itt, and that upon
$I that occasion you had excused your selfe from
$I coming to the Queen's funeral, whear I hoped to
$I have seen you, and am doubly sory upon this
$I occasion to faile of that contentment; ear long
$I I trust a happier one will bring us with gladnes
$I to meete, which I wish to you in as great a
$I measure as I do to
$I Your most affectionat freind and servant,
$I L. BEDFORD.

$I The K. is earnest to have the funeral hastened,
$I and sayth itt shall be on Saturday com se'night;
$I but, for all that, I thinke itt will not be till this day fortnight.

$I Bedford House, in haste, this Thursday morning, [April 1619].
