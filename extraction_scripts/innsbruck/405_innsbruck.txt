$I For the Right Wor=pfull=, Christopher Richardson, Mayor,
$I     and the Aldermen his Brethren, of Kingston
$I     upon Hull.
$I Gentlemen, my worthy friends,
$I    Although during the necessary absence of my partner M=r= Ramsden
$I I write but with halfe a penn, and can scarce perswade myselfe to send
$I you so imperfect an account of your own and the publick affairs as
$I I needs must for want of his assistance, yet I had rather expose mine
$I own defects to your good interpretation then excuse thereby a totall
$I neglect of my duty and that trust which is divided upon me. At my
$I late absence out of Town I had taken such order that if you had
$I commanded me any thing I might soon have received it and so returned
$I on purpose to this place to have obeyed you. But hearing nothing of
$I that nature, however I was present the first day of the Parliaments
$I sitting, and tooke care to write to M=r= Maior what work we had cut out.
$I Since when we have had litle new but onely been making a progresse in
$I those things I then mentioned. There is yet brought in an Act in
$I which of all others your corporation is the least concerned: that is
$I where wives shall refuse to cohabit with their husbands, that in such
$I case the husband shall not be liable to pay any debts which she shall
$I run into for clothing diet lodging or other expenses. I wish with all
$I my heart you were no more touched in a vote that we have made for
$I bringing in an Act of a new Assessment for six moneths of 70000=li= per
$I mensem to begin next January. The truth is the delay ere monyes can
$I be got in eats up a great part of all that is levying and that growing
$I charge of the Army and Navy doubles upon us. And that is all that
$I can be said for excuse of our selves to the Country to whom we had
$I giuen our own hopes of no further Sessment to be raised, but must now
$I needs incurre the censure of improvidence before or prodigality now,
$I though it becomes no private member, the resolution having passed
$I the house to interpose further his own judgement in a thing that can
$I not be remedied: and it will be each mans ingenuity not to grudge
$I an after-payment for that settlement and freedome from Armyes &
$I Navyes w=ch= before he would have been glad to purchase with his

<p. 2

$I whole fortune. There remain some eight Regiments to be disbanded
$I but those all horse in a manner and some seauenteen shipps to be
$I payd of that have laid so long upon charge in the harbour beside
$I fourscore shipps w=ch= are reckoned to us for this winter guard But
$I after that all things are to go upon his Majestyes own purse out of the
$I Tunnage & Poundage & his other revenues. But there being so
$I great a provision made for mony I doubt not but ere we rise to see the
$I whole army disbanded and, according to the Act, hope to see your
$I Town once more ungarrisond, in w=ch= I should be glad and happy to
$I be instrumentall to the uttermost For I can not but remember,
$I though then a child, those blessed days when the youth of your own
$I town were trained for your militia, and did methought become their
$I arms much better then any soldiers that I have seen there since. And
$I it will not be amisse if you please (now that we are about a new Act
$I of regulating the Militia that it may be as a standing strength but
$I not as ill as a perpetuall Army to the Nation) to signify to me any
$I thing in that matter that were according to your ancient custome &
$I desirable for you. For though I can promise litle yet I intend all
$I things for your service. The Act for review of the Poll bill proceeds
$I & that for making this declaration of his Majesty a Law in religious
$I matters. Order likewise is given for drawing up all the votes made
$I during our last sitting in the businesse of Sales of Bishops and Deans
$I and Chapters lands into an Act w=ch= I should be glad to see passd.
$I The purchasers the other day offerd the house 600000=li= in ready
$I mony & to make the Bishops &c: revenue as good or better then
$I before. But the House thought it not fit or seasonable to hearken
$I to it. We are so much the more concernd to see that great interest
$I of the purchasers satisfyed & quieted at least in that way which our
$I own votes have propounded. On Munday next we are to return to the
$I consideration of apportioning 100000=li= p ann~ upon all the lands in
$I the nation in lieu of the Court of Wards. The debate among the
$I Countyes each thinking it selfe over-rated makes the successe of that
$I businesse somthing casuall & truly I shall not assist it much for my
$I part for it is litle reason that your Town should contribute in that
$I charge. The Excise bill for longer continuance (I wish it prove not too
$I long) will come in also next weeke And I foresee we shall be called upon
$I shortly to effect our vote made the former sitting of raising his Majesties
$I revenue to 1200000=li= per Annum I do not love to write so much of
$I this mony news But I thinke you have observed that Parliaments
$I have been always made use of to that purpose, and though we may buy
$I gold too deare yet we must at any rate be glad of Peace Freedome
$I & a good Conscience. M=r= Maior tells me your duplicates of the Poll

<p. 3

$I are coming up I shall go with them to the Exchequer & make your
$I excuse if any be requisite. My long silence hath made me now tres_passe
$I on the other hand in a long letter but I doubt not of your good
$I construction of so much familiarity and trouble from
$I                           Gentlemen
$I                      Your most affectionate friend & servant
$I                            Andr: Marvell.
$I Westminster Nov: 17. 1660
