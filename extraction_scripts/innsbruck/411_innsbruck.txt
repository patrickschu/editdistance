$I To Mayor Richardson.
$I Worthy Sir,
$I    The businesse of the House hath not been of very publick consequence
$I yesterday, being taken up by a Petition preferrd by one M=r= Liddall
$I that the House would giue him leave to prosecute at law S=r= John Morly
$I a member of the House for Newcastle upon a charge of high Treason,
$I for some correspondence he had held with Oliuer Cromwell & mony
$I w=ch= he had in earnest thereof received of S=r= George Downing when
$I resident in Holland. For the kings meniall servants or those w=ch=
$I acted by instructions from the king, betraying their trust are excepted
$I out of the Act of Indemnity. The House left Liddall to prosecute him
$I at law. But I believe it will not signify much. To day, the Committee
$I hauing yesterday gone through the Act for Security of his Majestyes
$I person, all the amendments were read & agreed to and the bill put
$I to ingrossing. The Committee for Confirming the Acts of the last
$I Parlament sat yesterday also & are carrying l c on that businesse but
$I indeed the Bill then passd for confirmation of Ministers will I doubt
$I undergoe a very hard scrutiny; so that I think as I intimated to you
$I in my last, whosoever have the businesse of their ministers in a present
$I toler[able] and secure posture had best make much of that and [not]
$I expose themselves to a further hazard. I belieue in [this] conjuncture
$I I shall be left single in attempting any thing for your patronage
$I notwithstanding the assistance you expected from some others. For
$I so they signify to me. And I doubt you will hardly agree about the
$I levying of your ministers maintenance. But in this thing according
$I as I write to you you must please to be very reserved & rest very
$I much upon your own prudence. I would not haue you suspect any
$I misintelligence betwixt my partner & me because we write not to
$I you joyntly as M=r= Ramsden & I used. For there is all civility
$I betwixt us. But it was his sense that we should each be left to his
$I own discretion for writing except upon some answer unto your Letters
$I & that to be joyntly. I send you these Proclamations.
$I                                 I am
$I                         Your most affectionate friend to serve you
$I                                         Andr: Marvell.
$I Westm: May 16 1661.

$I To Mayor Richardson.
$I          Westm: May 18. 1661.
$I Gentlemen, our very worthy friends,
$I    We would not let the first letter w=ch= we haue had the honour to
$I receiue from you (of the 14 May) ly by us without returne till the next
$I Post, chusing rather to be something imperfect then wholy defective
$I in answering you about your businesse & rendring our own due
$I respects & civilityes to you. We are willingly quickened by you
$I for the Act of Separation of your Church from Hessel & thank you
$I for what you contribute towards it in the papers you inclosed. Whereby
$I there seems to us litle to be wanting towards the expedition of that
$I Bill w=ch= is in good forwardnesse to be presented to the House but
$I that you be pleased to deale with all those in your towne who shall
$I by this Act be made contributory to such maintenance for your
$I Minister, for their general & particular consent towards it by their
$I subscribing to a paper testifying their assent. For the Parlament is
$I always very nice & curious in this point of involving men in any
$I sesse or contribution of this nature without their voluntary &
$I expresse concurrence. Insomuch that this last Parlament in a case
$I of the like nature for Royston nothing could be done till that were
$I first done, & the want of two or three hands concerned did put
$I a stop for some time to that businesse. Though this seeme somthing
$I longsome to us & you who are equally desirous of the effect, yet
$I nothing is long that is necessary, nor that time lost w=ch= makes the
$I businesse at last go of clearer. That Patent of ballast is grievous alike
$I to all the ports & if we can pitch upon some common way to seek
$I redresse, with that modesty w=ch= is expedient where his Mt=yes= seale
$I is in the case, we shall incite and joyn with those that haue the
$I same interest. As to your Patent for the gaging of wines & your
$I former power to grant foure wine licences it shall be our care betwixt
$I this & our next letter to giue you a good account and do you the
$I best service therein as in all other matters recommended by you or
$I occurring to us. The newest matters here are the ingrossing of the Act
$I for safety of the kings person. The bill for the Militia read once. A bill
$I for inabling Church-wardens to rate such monys as are necessary for the
$I repaire of the Churches &c: and an order sent to the Lords for their
$I concurrence for burning the Covenant by the Common Hangman &
$I taking it down in all churches: which though not unanimous yet was
$I carried by 228 voices against 103. We are as much straitned in paper

<p. 25

$I and time at present as we shall be always inlarged in affection &
$I service to you being
$I              Your most affectionate friends to serve you
$I                 Antho Gylby Andr: Marvell.
$I    We see among the rest of your papers that declaration of M=r= Raiks
$I his (before he had got Hessell) toward the separation. Tis as necessary
$I that (now he is possessd of Hessell) he do some new writing witnesse
$I his consent thereto
$I                         Antho Gylby.
$I                         Andr: Marvell.
