$I    Right Honourable,
$I       This is only to signify unto his Majesty that by God's favour,
$I within two or three days after the date thereof, we shall depart
$I from hence; so as my next will be from Augusta, where there is, as
$I you know, a feat to be done, for which the party is well prepared.
$I I leave here (as Sir Dudley Carleton did during the whole time of
$I his negotiation in Piedmont) Gregorio de' Monti, to supply the service
$I by continual advertisements; upon which point I gave a touch, at
$I my leave-taking to the Prince, desiring him to esteem it as an
$I argument of clear and disumbrageous friendship, that we serve
$I ourselves even of his own subjects; for Gregorio is a natural
$I Venetian, though now many years as it were Englished, with
$I singular approvement both of his fidelity, diligence, and discretion.
$I Whereof he hath likewise a testimony from his Majesty, under his
$I royal hand, sent him in the time of Sir Ralphe Winwoode, for his
$I better encouragement, after my predecessor and myself had repre_sented
$I his good deservings.
$I Now to return to myself. I carry in my breast, besides that
$I honest business which you know, some important commissions
$I from this State which have a silent reflection (though not meant by

<p. 173

$I them) upon our main end. These I shall particularize in my letter
$I from Augusta; and will end the present with mine humble thanks
$I to Almighty God for the happy news, which we have had this week,
$I of his Majesty's escape from a painful infirmity. The same good
$I God yield him long unto us and to the Christian world.
$I                        And so I rest,
$I                             At your Honour's commandment,
$I                                       HENRY WOTTON.
