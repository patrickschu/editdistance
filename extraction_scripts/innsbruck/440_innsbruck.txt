$I Gentlemen my very worthy friends,
$I    This hath been the third day that the House of Commons hath been
$I upon the consideration of the Leagues with Holland and what depends
$I thereon. This day hath lasted continuall sitting till nine at night and
$I hath produced these three votes inclosed. There is a generall appre_hension
$I lest the Hollanders haue already made their conditions with
$I France. I must beg your pardon if I be not punctuall for you see in
$I the third vote, that upon hast one may be excused even from using
$I the formalityes due to the Prince, much more will you dispense with
$I Gentlemen,
$I                         Your most affectionate serv=t=
$I                              Andr: Marvell
$I    Westm: May. 4. 1678.
