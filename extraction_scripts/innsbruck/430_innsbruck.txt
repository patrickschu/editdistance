$I To Mr. Bohun at Oxford.
$I S=r=,
$I Do not think my silence hitherto has proceeded
$I from being taken up with the diversions of the
$I towne, the eclat of the wedding, mascarades which
$I trebled their number the second night of the wed_ding
$I [so] that there was great disorder and confu_sion
$I caused by it, and with which the solemnity
$I ended; neither can I charge the houswifry of the
$I country after my returne, or treating my neigb_bours
$I this Christmas, since I never finde any buisi_nesse
$I or recreation that rnakes me forget my friends.

<p. 434

$I Should I confesse the reall cause, it is y=r= expecta_tion
$I of extraordinary notions of things wholy out
$I of my way:  Women were not borne to reade au_thors,
$I and censure the learned, to compare lives and
$I judge of virtues, to give rules of morality, and sa_crifice
$I to the Muses.  We are willing to  acknow_ledge
$I all time borrowed from family duties is mis_spent;
$I the care of children's education, observing
$I a husband's comands, assisting the sick, relieving
$I the poore, and being servicable to our friends, are
$I of sufficient weight to employ the most improved
$I capacities amongst us. If sometimes it happens by
$I accident that one of a thousaud aspires a little
$I higher, her fate commonly exposes her to wonder,
$I but adds little to esteeme. The distaff will defend
$I our quarrels as well as the sword, and the needle is
$I as instructive as the penne. A heroine is a kinde
$I of prodigy; the influence of a blasing starre is not
$I more dangerous, or more avoyded. Though I have
$I lived under the  roofe of the learned, and in the
$I neighbourhood of science, it has had no other effect
$I on such a temper as mine, but that of admiration,
$I aud that too but when it is reduced to practice. I
$I confesse I am infnitely delighted to meet with in
$I books the atchievements of the heroes, with the
$I calmnesse of philosophers, and with the eloquence
$I of orators; but what charms  me irresistably is to
$I see perfect resignation in the minds of men what
$I ever happens adverse to them in their fortune; that

<p. 435

$I is being knowing and truly wise; it confirms my
$I beleefe of antiquity, and engages my perswasion of
$I future perfection, without which it were in vaine to
$I live. Hope not for volumes or treatises; raillery
$I may make me goe beyonde my bounds, but when
$I serious, I esteeme myselfe capable of very little, yet
$I I am, S=r=,
$I Your friend and servant,
$I M. E.
$I Jan. 4, 1672.
