$I DEAR MADAM,
$I ITT wold have eased me of a great deale of care
$I if I might by your servant have heard that you
$I had recovered better health; which good newse
$I since I cannot yett reseave, I will content myselfe
$I with this hope, that this sicknes will in the ende
$I pay you much comfort for the payne and troble it
$I putts you to, and so make me amends that am by
$I itt denied your company, which I so much desired,
$I as I also did Mr Bacon's, but not with the least
$I wishe to deprive you in this state of your greatest
$I comfort. Som other tyme, I hope, will be more
$I fortunat to me then this any way is, and nonne
$I shall I esteem more so then that which may bring
$I forth an oportunity for me to testify the un_faynednes
$I of that respect hath so often binne
$I vowed unto you by your most affectionat and
$I faythfull freind, L BEDF_ORD
$I Huntingdon, this 11th of April [1618].

$I affectionatly kisse your hands, as I do Mr
$I Bacon's. You have sent me a present I so much
$I esteem as I know not how to find you sufficient
$I thankes for itt, and can only acknowledge itt to
$I be the finest I ever saw of this kind.
$I To my worthy freind the Lady Cornewallis.
