$I To my very loving friend Mr. Storie, at the Sign of the Dog in
$I      the Royal Exchange, London: Deliver these.

$I      MR. STORIE,          St. Ives, 11th January 1635.

$I    Amongst the catalogue of those good works which
$I your fellow-citizens and our countrymen have done,
$I this will not be reckoned for the least, That they have
$I provided for the feeding of souls. Building of  hos_pitals
$I provides for men's bodies; to build material
$I temples is judged a work of piety; but they that pro_cure
$I spiritual food, they that build up spiritual temples,
$I they are the men truly charitable, truly pious. Such
$I a work as this was your erecting the Lecture in our
$I Country; in the which you placed Dr. Wells, a man of
$I goodness and industry, and ability to do good every
$I way, not short of any I know in England: and I am
$I persuaded that, sithence his coming, the Lord hath by
$I him wrought much good among us.
$I    It only remains how that He who first moved you
$I to this, put you forward in the continuance thereof: it
$I was the Lord; and therefore to Him lift we up our
$I hearts that He would perfect it. And surely, Mr. Storie,
$I it were a piteous thing to see a Lecture fall, in the

<p. 88

$I hands of so many able and godly men, as I am per_suaded
$I the founders of this are; in these times, wherein
$I we see they are suppressed, with too much haste and
$I violence, by the enemies of God his Truth. Far be it
$I that so much guilt should stick to your hands, who live
$I in a City so renowned for the clear shining light of the
$I Gospel. You know, Mr. Storie, to withdraw the pay
$I is to let fall the Lecture: for who goeth to warfare at
$I his own cost? I beseech you therefore in the bowels
$I of Jesus Christ, put it forward, and let the good man
$I have his pay. The souls of God's children will bless
$I you for it: and so shall I; and ever rest,
$I           Your loving Friend in the Lord,
$I                                    OLIVER CROMWELL.
$I    Commend my hearty love to Mr. Busse, Mr. Beadly,
$I and my other good friends. I would have written to
$I Mr. Busse; but I was loath to trouble him with a long
$I letter, and I feared I should not receive an answer from
$I him: from you I expect one so soon as conveniently
$I you may.   Vale. 
