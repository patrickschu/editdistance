$I 'To his Eminency Cardinal Mazarin.'
$I 'Whitehall,' 26th December 1656.
$I    The obligations, and many instances of affection,
$I which I  have received from your eminency, do engage
$I me to make returns suitable to your merits. But al_though
$I I have this set home upon my spirit, I may
$I not (shall I tell you, I cannot?) at this juncture of
$I time, and as the face of my affairs now stands, answer
$I to your call for Toleration.
$I   I say, I cannot, as to a public declaration of my
$I sense in that point; although I believe that under my
$I government your eminency, in the behalf of catholics,
$I has less reason for complaint as to rigour  upon men's
$I consciences than under the parliament. For I have of
$I some, and  those very many, had compassion; making
$I a difference. Truly I have (and I may speak it with
$I cheerfulness in the presence of god, who is a witness
$I within me to the truth of what I affirm) made a differ_ence;
$I and, as Jude speaks, "plucked many out of the
$I fire,"  the raging fire of persecution, which did

<p. 6

$I tyrannise over their consciences, and encroached by an
$I arbitrariness of power upon their estates. And herein
$I is my purpose, as soon as I can remove impediments,
$I and some weights that press me down, to make a
$I farther progress, and discharge  my promise to your
$I eminency in relation to that.
$I And now I shall come to return your Eminency
$I thanks for your judicious choice of that person to whom
$I you have entrusted our weightiest Affair: an Affair
$I wherein your Eminency is concerned, though not in an
$I equal degree and measure with myself. I must confess
$I that I had some doubts of its success, till providence
$I cleared them to me by the effects. I was, truly and
$I to speak ingenuously, not without doubtings; and shall
$I not be ashamed to give your eminency the grounds I
$I had for much doubting. I did fear that Berkley would
$I not have been able to go through and carry on that
$I work; and that either the Duke would have cooled in
$I his suit, or condescended to his Brother. I doubted
$I also that those Instructions which I sent over with
$I 290 were not clear enough as to expressions; some
$I affairs here denying me leisure at that time to be so
$I particular as in regard to some circumstances, I
$I would. If I am not mistaken in the Duke's
$I character, as I received it from your Eminency, that
$I fire which is kindled between  them will not ask bellows
$I to blow it, and keep it burning. But what I think
$I farther necessary in this matter I will send to your
$I Eminency by Lockhart.
$I and now I shall boast to your Eminency my se_curity

<p. 7

$I upon a well-builded confidence in the Lord: for
$I I distrust not but if this breach be widened a little
$I more, and this difference fomented, with a little caution
$I in respect of the persons to be added to it,  I distrust
$I not but that Party, which is already forsaken of God
$I as to an outward dispensation of mercies, and noisome
$I to their countrymen, will grow lower in the opinion of
$I all the world.
$I    If I have troubled your Eminency too long in this,
$I you may impute it to the resentment of joy which I
$I have for the issue of this Affair; and `I' will conclude
$I with giving you assurance that I will never be back_ward
$I in demonstrating, as becomes your brother and
$I confederate, that I am,
$I             Your servant,
$I                      Oliver P. 
