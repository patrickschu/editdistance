$I MY LORD

$I your request shall make his folly more manifest to
$I the world, wyche wyll more greve me than the want
$I of hys spekyng. I wold not wyssche yow importune
$I for hys good wyll, yf yt cum nott frankely at the fyrst,
$I yt schalbe suffycyent ones to have requyre yt, and

$I to repayre hether ye must take sum payne to come
