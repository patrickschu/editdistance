$I                        From Venice, this 26th of July, 1618.
$I    RIGHT HONOURABLE,
$I       Under this date I write two letters unto you; whereof the
$I present is the latter,and is written to correct the former. For
$I whereas in the same I advertised that an execution had been done
$I upon certain mutinous persons of the Holland troops, that had
$I fortified themselves against the General on the shore of Dalmatia
$I (which I took from the first voice) there is now (though I am sorry
$I to express it) fresher advice come from the armata that those
$I mutineers were English, and of the late arrived under Sir Henry
$I Peyton's conduct, to the number of some 150, who demanded the
$I same pay that the foresaid Hollanders had, and made that the subject
$I of their division. To which the General made answer, that he would
$I stand to the contract concluded between the amabassador of this
$I State and their conductor in England, and therfore wished them to
$I be quiet; which they refusing, he landed 200 Albanesi to reduce
$I them by force, against whom the English turned their pikes and

<p. 153

$I their shot, which the general perceiving, he laid the prows of two of
$I his galleys against them, and so they yielded. Barbarigo upon this
$I forming their process, did hang eight of them, who are said to be
$I captains, lieutenants, and corporals, and that three of these did
$I die in the Roman faith. their names I yet know not, which shall
$I be advertised in my next. God send the success fairer than the
$I beginning.
$I    To this I must add that by the letters of Milan arrived at this
$I moment, is intimated a secret conjunction between Fraunce and Savoy
$I against the Genovese, which if it proceed, will inflame this whole
$I country. These be resolutions proper for the canicular days, which
$I are newly begun with us. And so, Sir, wishing us the continuance
$I of blessed peace at home,I humbly rest,
$I                                    At your commandments,
$I                                                  HENRY WOTTON.
