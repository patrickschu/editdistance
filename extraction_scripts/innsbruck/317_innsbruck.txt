$I DEARE CORNEWALLIS, â€” I am sorry Mr Bacon
$I and you are so punctual observers of the comande_ment

<p. 85

$I empties this towne, which itt is now too
$I late, in regard of the state you are in, to tell you,
$I that if I had thought that had binne any stay to
$I your being a Londoner this winter, l wolde have
$I donne you the servis to have gotten you a dispen_sation;
$I whos companie I should have binne ex_tream
$I glad to have had hear, whear I shall be
$I for the most part till the spring: and though in
$I this I am a greate looser, yett itt trobles me more to
$I hear how aprehensive you are of a danger itt
$I hath pleased God to carry you so often safely
$I through, and so I doubt not will againe, though
$I you may do yourselfe and yours much harme, by
$I those doubtings and ill companions for all persons,
$I and worst for us splenetick creatures. Therfore,
$I dear Cornewallis, lett not this melancholy prevale
$I with you to the begetting or nourishing of those
$I mistrusts will turne more to your hurt than that
$I you feare, which I hope will passe with safety and
$I end to your comfort, unto which if I could tell
$I how hear or thear to advise any thing, I wold
$I affectionatly endeavour att in absence, and readily
$I undertake a longer jorney to you than itt is to
$I Broome; for though I have long suffered under a
$I condicion hath maimed me of all means in real
$I effects to express itt, and hath almost made me

<p. 86

$I hate fruitles professions, yett ther is no freind
$I more sensible of what they owe to another, nor
$I fuller of earnest desiers to deserve well of them,
$I than my hart can wittnes I am towards you, to
$I whom I am not in so much despayre of making itt
$I appear as I have binne, nor, I hope, are you lesse
$I confident that itt is an unfained truth, that I am,
$I Yor most affectionatly faithfull freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.

$I Harington House, this 28 of November [1623].
$I I will write you no newse, for that I leave to
$I Mr Bacon, who may hear in the towne very near
$I as much as I know, since what is like a secret
$I passeth underneath, and so sounds not so farre as
$I this end of the towne; only I will give you my
$I testimony that the Prince is the most improved
$I man that ever I saw, and that my Lo. of Buck_ingham
$I recovers much of what he had lost, so as
$I you may see that the only Wyse, who brings light
$I out of darknes, can favour us by ways we could
$I not imagine could have produced such happy
$I effects. The litle juel you sent me is a tresure,
$I being the finest and best that I thinke was ever of
$I her kind, for which since I cannot thanke you
$I enuffe, I will use no words to thanke you for at all.

$I To my noble and worthy freind the Lady Cornewallis.
