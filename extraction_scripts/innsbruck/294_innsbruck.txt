$I DEARE MADAM, â€” I have nothing to acuse you
$I of, though you cannot but condemne me as a
$I promis breaker, and so unmannerly a one as not

<p. 47

$I so much as to have excused myselfe to you; but I
$I must treuly protest that every weeke since my
$I coming out of Warwickshier I have binne setting a
$I day to com to you. From thence I was forsed to
$I follow the K. by his co(andement for the setling
$I of a busnes I have long had in hand for his servis
$I and my profitt, and so could not gett the liberty
$I of 2 or 3 days to goe into Rutland, nor since my
$I coming to this towne to leave itt so many days as
$I wold have brought me to you and backe againe;
$I which I protest I have as much desired as I now
$I do any thing, and resolve if you com up this
$I winter, which I am putte in som hopes you will,
$I to lett you see neither winter weather nor ways
$I can fright me from performing before Chrismas
$I what I could not in the summer; though I should
$I be extream glad to hear we should meete in this
$I good towne, because then I should hope to be
$I much the longer in your company, and to have
$I your advise and Mr Bacon's in my workes att the
$I More, whear I have binne a patcher this sommer,
$I and I am still adding som trifles of pleasure to
$I that place I am so much in love with, as, if I
$I wear so fond of any man, I wear in hard case.
$I The last busness of this letter is, to beg of you
$I the knowledge how you and yours doe, and the
$I favor I may be affectionatly remembred to Mr
$I Bacon, and ever by you, as in all essentiall things
$I I will be found, the trewest of your freinds,
$I L. BEDFORD.

<P. 48

$I The Queene hath binne very ill of late, but
$I is now well againe. The noble Lady Roxbrough
$I is in Scotland, which makes me perfectly hate the court.

$I Bedford House, this 22d of October [1617].
$I To my very worthy freind the Lady Cornewallis.
