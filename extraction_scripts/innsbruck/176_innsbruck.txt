$I   Mr. Wallop after my right hartie commendations where the
$I Kinges Maiestie hath receyved certain aduertisementes from
$I a very good place which his Maieste thinketh dothe muche
$I touche his good brother the Frenche King. And that it were
$I very expedyent he had knowlege of the same. His hieghnes
$I hathe thought conuenyent to write the same vnto you to
$I thintent you maye declare them to the quene of Navarre
$I which his hieghnes wold you shuld doo at your first opor_tunyte.
$I The particulers be thesse. First his Maieste ys
$I aduised that the Constable and Cardinal of Lorrien shal at
$I their cummyng in to Flaunders rather be entretayned with
$I chere to shewe an apparaunce of amyte thenne growe to any
$I conclusion of thinges according to the french kinges desier.
$I Second yt is aduertised howe the legate for Farneze by his
$I Gouernor Marsselles dyd move the Frenche King lately by
$I the bishop of Romez commaundement to mak difficulte
$I a while in his conclusion betwene him and the Emperour,
$I Saying that the necessite of Themperour shuld thereby cause
$I him to haue what he wold desier, Whereunto the Frenche
$I King shuld aunswere that if Themperour wold lyve as he
$I dothe in peace and friendshipp he wold doo his best allwaye
$I to shewe lyk correspondence. But if he would treate any
$I further thing It must be for all dependauntes or elles nothing.
$I The latter ende of his saying, that is to saye, The Frenche
$I Kinges aunswere onely was secretly reaported to Themperour.
$I And whenne the Reaporter sayd that all dependauntes included
$I manny thinges aswel Burgoyn Navarre treaties of Madril as
$I Millan and Pyemount, Themperour aunswered that of throuthe
$I the thinges were mervelously intricate, Adding that at the
$I treating at Perpynyon he being thenne at Bersolona, he
$I thought it not best to come to any particulers And Euen
$I soo wolde be lothe yet to com to them For quoth he there is
$I daunger of vnhonest condicions or of discontentement at
$I departing. And therefore it is thought and sayd that to
$I wynne a further delaye The King of Romaynez shal also
$I goo to vysyt the Frenche King and by these meanes shal
$I Themperour thus wynne tyme and tak his aduantage in other
$I parties having as the Kinges Maieste ys aduised a secret
$I fantazie in his hed That being the Frenche King sickly and
$I diseased (which is muche to the kinges hieghnes regrete) he
$I deuiseth howe by meanes to protract and wynne Loking for
$I that which his grace trusteth he shal not see and thinking if
$I he were ones passed he shuld easly ynough Frame al his
$I purposes after Euen as he himself wold wyshe and desier.
$I Nowe you may require Madame de Navarre to consider what
$I these thinges doo saver and in case she shal think that the
$I knowlege of them maiye anything conferre to the Frenche
$I Kinges Benefyt She may open the same at her pleasure and
$I by oone point she may presently Knowe whether any of the
$I rest be lyk to be true that is by the woordes spoken by the
$I Frenche King himself touching thek dependauntes wherein
$I you may presse her to tak som pains to knowe the certaynte
$I as a meane to waye the better the residue Albeyt his Maieste
$I doubteth not but in case the constable do not growe to a
$I thorow agrement But shalbe put of by delayes newe Inven_cions
$I and deuises. His good Brother the frenche king shal
$I easly by the same conuert Themperours mynd and purpose.
$I And what aunswere she shal presentely or vppon deliberacion
$I and inquerye make vnto you, His Maiestes pleasure is you
$I shal aduertise with conuenyent diligence Joynyng to your
$I aduertisementes suche other occurrauntes as you shal there
$I lerne from time to tyme worthie his graces knowlege. You
$I may also shewe to the quene of Navarre That in lyk maner
$I from a good place his Maieste ys aduertised that in Spayn
$I they beginne to Murmur for that Themperour shuld practise
$I the Maryeng for himself & his children without theyr con_sentes,
$I Saying they will kepe a parlyament vppon that and
$I such other maters Whereuppon it is thought he woll send
$I thither the Duke of Alva to doo what he canne tappease and
$I quiet them Whereby it appereth that were it not onely for
$I thestimacion that he hath by the Frenche King he were lyk
$I shortely to haue busynes ynough to turn him to. Thus ad_uising
$I you that the Kinges hieghnes ys in good helth with all
$I your frendes here I byd you hertely well to Fare from
$I London the xij=th= of march
$I    Endd. To Mr. Wallop xij marcij
