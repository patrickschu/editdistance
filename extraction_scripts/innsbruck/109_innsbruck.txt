$I To the Kynges Most Noble Grace.
$I   About the last day of Septembre last past, being in
$I a secrett counter within your deputie is place at Calis,
$I he, Sir Hughe Conway, your treserer ther, and Sir
$I Sampson Norton, master porter of that your sayd
$I toune, clad to them my brodre William Nanfan and
$I me. Then said my master your depute to us, "Sirs,
$I we must comyn here now of many great matres
$I touchyng the kyngis grace and the surtie of this hys
$I toune of Calis. Therfore by cause ye be next unto
$I me, I must somtyme put you in tryst more then other.
$I Ye shall hyre here thees matrys that we intend to
$I comyn of; but first ye shall be bothe sworen upon
$I a boke that ye shall never utter nothyng that is now
$I here spoken, without it be to the kyngis grace yf nede
$I shall require, or els to non lyvyng creature." Then
$I after many matris spoken by my master your depute
$I and resonned to the same by your treserer and porter,
$I wiche matres and wherof they were I ame and shalbe
$I [ready] to shew to your hygnes at suche tyme or tymes
$I that best shall plese your grace that I so do.
$I   Then seid Sir Hyghe Conwaye, "Master depute, yf
$I ye knew as moche as I do, ye wolde saye that ye hade
$I asgrett cause to take kepe to your sylfe as ony lyvyng
$I creature; and therto ye be asmuche bownden to thank
$I God for that ye have askaped heherto as ye have, for
$I I know thoos persons that have be sett to murdre you,
$I and by whoos cause and menys they so dyde." Mi
$I master askyd hym what they were he wold then shew
$I hym, but seid that he wold shew hym more of that
$I mater at a nodre tyme when we shall have more
$I layser. So for what he said now ame I and master
$I porter asfyr into the daunce as ye be, for I promyse
$I you of my faythe that all thoos that be and were
$I profferred hydre into ther romes by my Lord Chamber_layn
$I shall never love non of us, and specially thoos that
$I were his houssold servauntis tofore. The cause whij
$I they soo do I cannot tell, but for that we folow the
$I kyngis plesure and so wildo. Therfor good yt is that
$I we see to our owne surtie, aswell as for the surtie
$I of this the kyngis toune, that yt may be sure to hym
$I and his, wat world so ever shall hapen to fall here
$I after, to have in remembrans that the gretter and
$I more partie of thoos that be in the kyngis retenu here
$I be of my lordis prefferment. Also loke hoo stronge
$I he is in the kyngis courte of his houshold servauntis
$I for the more partie of his garde be of thoos that were
$I my Lord Chamberlayn servauntis tofore. and hard hyt
$I is to know mennys myndis yf God should send a
$I soden change, as he hayth here tofore.
$I   Then said my master, your depute, that "I darst
$I reseve the sacrament that my lord is as true to the
$I kyngis grace as ony man lyvyng," and in lyke wyse

<p. 232

$I seid master porter.
$I   Item, My master your depute, said, "My lord Chamber_layn
$I was very shlake in oone jorny, wherwith I
$I knowell that the kinigis grace was discontent; for and
$I he had done his parte welle, the Cornyshe men hade
$I never made the kynge feld at Blake hethe, but had all
$I ben distroyed longe before ther comyng thedre, that I
$I knowell the kyngis grace hade lever hade be done
$I then xx=ml= for his honour.
$I   Item, after many wordes spoken, Sir Hughe Conwey
$I seid, "Mastres, I hanot spoken theys wordis for no
$I untrothe that I do thynk be now in my lord Cham_berlayn,

<p. 233

$I for I dar say now as ye do that he lovyth
$I the kynge aswell as any man cando lyvyng; but yt
$I hath be sene in tymys past that chaynge of worldis
$I hayth caused chaynge of mynd."
$I   Item, the same Sir Hughe said, that "we be here,
$I now togedres the kyngis true servauntis to lyve and dy,
$I and also to spend all that we have in the world to
$I do his grace servis. Therfore watt so ever we speke
$I or comyn for his surtie, and for the surtie of this his
$I toune, canbe no tresone; so good yt is that we loke
$I and speke of thyngis to come as well as thoos present.
$I I do speke this for a cause that is good that we loke
$I sadly to, for the kyngis grace is but a weke man and
$I syklow, not lykly to be no longe lyvis man. Yt ys not
$I longe sithens his hygnes was syke and lay then in his
$I maner in Wangsted. Hyt hapned the same tyme me
$I to be emonges many grett personages, the whiche fele
$I in communicacion of the kyngis grace and of the world
$I that shouldbe after hym yf hys grace hapned to depart."
$I Then he said that some of them spake of my lorde of
$I Buckyngham, sayng that he was a noble man and
$I woldbe a ryall ruler. Other ther were that spake, he
$I said, in lykewyse of your troytor Edmond De la Pole,
$I but none of them, he said, that spake of my lord
$I prynce. Then said master porter to hym, "Have ye
$I never broken to the kyngis grace of this mater?"
$I Then said Sir Hughe Conway to hym agayn, "I pray
$I you souffer me to tell forthe my talle, for I amnot
$I yet athe ynd. Ye have in mynde wat that I have
$I shewed you touchyng this matris. Of my fayth, in lyke
$I wyse sythens my comyng I have shewed the same to
$I Sir Nycholas Voux, lieutenant of Gysnes, and to Sir
$I Antony Broune, lieutenant of the castell here, and
$I they answeryd me both this, that they had to good
$I holdes to resorte unto, the whiche thay seid sholdbe
$I sure to make their paxce, ho so ever the worlde tourne."
$I Then my master youre depute, and master porter,

<p. 234

$I boyth said to hym that he could no lase doo but shew
$I thes matres unto youre hyghnes. He said that, "Hyt
$I ware good that the kyngis grace knew thees sayyngis,
$I but asyet I have not shewed hym no part heroff,
$I nother never I wildo." Then said master porter to
$I hym angrely, and sware by Godis precious soule he
$I be the more to blame to kepe suche matris from his
$I hygnes; and in lyke wyse said my master your
$I depute, and all we beyyng there.
$I   Item, after many wordis spoken touchyng the
$I same, Sir Hughe Conway said, "Yf ye knew kynge
$I Harry oure master as I doo, ye woldbe ware how that
$I ye brake to hym in ony suche matres, for he wold
$I take yt to be said but of envy, yll wille and malis.
$I Then should anion have blame and no thanke for his
$I trouth and good mynd; and that have I welle proved
$I here to fore in lyke causes, for that tyme that the
$I lord Lovell lay in Colchester a trysty frend of myn
$I came to me and shewed me in councell the day and
$I tyme of hys departyng, and of alle hys purpos. I was
$I sworen to hym that I should never utter thys to man
$I lyvyng to hys hurte; butt yet forthwith after wardis,
$I by cause of my alegens, I came to Sir Raynold Bray
$I and shewed hym all as is abovwe, and forthwith he said
$I that Master Bray shewed the same unto the kyngis.
$I Wheruppon I was brought byfore hys hygnes and I
$I affirmed all to be true as my seid frend hade shewed;
$I and the kynge said that hyt could not be so, and
$I resoned with me alwayes to the contrary of my said
$I sayynges. At last he asked what he was that told me
$I thus tale of hys departyng. I prayed hys hygnes to
$I pardon me, for I said that I was sworen to hym that I
$I should never utter hym, to be drawen with wyld
$I horsses; wherewith the kynge was angry and displesed

<p. 235

$I with me for my good wille. I shall no more tempt hym
$I wile I lyve in suche causes." Then said master porter,
$I "I thynk that ye drast never speke thees wordes to
$I the kyngis grace as ye have rehersed them now here,"
$I and he sware my grett othes that he dyde.
$I   Item, my master youre deputie said that "I knowell
$I that the kyngis hyghnes is harde of credens in suche
$I matres; and that knowe ye," he said, "master porter,
$I aswell as I, for how longe was yt er hys grace and
$I hys councell wold belyve ony thyng of untrothe to be
$I in Sir Jame Tyrell; and some said I dyd seke to do
$I hym hurte for malis."
$I   "Item, a nodre tyme I dyd wryt unto hys hygnes
$I that oone hade shewed me that Sir Robert Clyfford
$I should say here in his toune to a lady that Perken
$I Warbeke was kynge Edwardes sone. Never wordes
$I went coldre to my hart then they dyd. Hys hygnes
$I sent me sharpe wrytyng agay that he wold have the
$I prouffe of this matier. I hade no wittnes then, but my
$I sylfe; but as hyt hapned afterwardes I caused hym by
$I good crafte to confesse the same he had said to me
$I be fore hym that was marshell here at that tyme, and
$I els I hade lykly to be putt to a grett plonge for my
$I trothe. At the last al thought that hit was not to
$I shewe this to youre grace without better proffe; yet
$I master porter said yt was grett pitty that the kinge
$I dyd not tryst hys true knyghtes better, and to geve
$I them credens in suche thynges as they should shew
$I for hys surtie, for grett hurt may come by that mene."
$I   Item, after this the treserer said, "Master depute and
$I master porter, what daunger be we in now, remem_bryng
$I all thynges welle, for we have no suche holdes,
$I to resort unto as thees other men have, consydryng
$I also oure many enymies that we have in this toune and

<p. 236

$I els where that wilbe glade to distroy and murdre us all
$I yf other should come to the kyngis grace then wele.
$I And for trothe I knowell that he cannot longe con_tynu
$I for hyt is wryten of hym that he shall no longer
$I raygne then dyd kynge Edward, wiche", he said, "was
$I byt xxij=te= yere and lytle more." Then said my master
$I youre depute, "I by sherwe hys hart that so dyde
$I wryte, and also I pray god send all them that thynk
$I the same tobe true a shorte shamfull dethe." The
$I treserer said agayn, "We may not be angry in this
$I matris when we shall comyn for the surtie of our
$I sylfes aswell as of this the kyngis toune, for I thynk
$I not veryly thus to be all true that I have said, but I
$I knowell that every man ys mortall and must dij, and
$I that that I have said I shall shew you my boke that
$I shall declare you the same playnly to be as I have said
$I and spoken." Master porter said, "Then I pray you,
$I master tresere, brene that boke, and a vayngens take
$I the first wryter."
$I   Item, then said my master youre depute to master
$I Convaye, "I pray you leve thys profyciyng of the
$I kynge, for ye speke of thynges that I never kepe
$I never hire nor see, and that my prayer is that I never
$I leve day nother oure longer then the kyngis grace
$I and hys chyldre shall have and inyoye the realme of
$I Inglond." And likevise spake master porter and we
$I all beyng there.
$I   Item, then said master Conway, "All this that I
$I have spoken is to thentent to have all thynges to be
$I made sure for the kynge and hys chyldre, and specially
$I this hys toune of Calis; and that cane never be done
$I without good and wyse comunycacion had of the same
$I byfore; for I tell you for surtie that that shall never
$I be aslonge as the lady Luse shalbe in the castell, that
$I we cane sure the kynge of thys hys toune, for the
$I castell is the kay of this toune; he that is therin
$I beyng of a contray mynd may lett men inow in

<p. 237

$I oone nyght to distrij us alle wyle we shalbe in oure
$I beddes sleepyng. I knowe, masters," he said, "wat
$I longeth to suche matres better then ye do; therfore
$I I pray you seuffer me for to speke. Lett not us
$I thynk the contrarij but and the kyngis were ons
$I departyd, she beyng in the castell here and Edmond
$I De la Pole hire cosen at hys lyberte, but that
$I she wolde helpe hym in hys causes with all hire
$I poure and to lett hym come into this toune by the
$I postren of the castell to the distruccion of us
$I alle. Remenbre welle how ny that Kent is hydre, wat
$I a lyans thay be of there." He spake of Sir Edward Poy_nynges,
$I Syr Rychard Gylforth, Sir Thomas Bouchir.
$I Wat he said of her demener, master porte, yf youre
$I grace exammen hym cane shew youre hygnes better
$I then I can do. Also he said, "Remenbre all the
$I company of this the kynges retenu here, wat ille mynde
$I they bere unto us that wilbe all redy then to folow
$I hyre mynd as they doo now, and to doo us the most
$I myschyffe thay cando," and named Rychard Wod_house
$I and John Clynton speris. Item, Raynold of
$I the Chambre, a constable of the retenu, with other.
$I "Thees men," he said, "never lovyd the kyngis
$I grace, nor never woldo, with many mo of the same
$I mynd within this toune. Now I have shewed all
$I the wyrst. This be a sherwde company sett in yll
$I mynde. Dout ye not but this will falle in dede
$I but good provysion be made for the remedy in tyme."
$I   Item, then said my master your depute, "Yf suche
$I thyng shall happen, as I pray God that I never
$I leve to se, the kyngis grace to departe byfore me,
$I but and yt please God that he shall so do, to be for
$I the surte and use of my lorde prynce and for all my
$I mastris childre to have this toune alle tymes at ther
$I owne wille and rule; and rather then yt shouldbe
$I otherwyse I hade lever souffer dethe. And we do
$I wysly, I doutnot but by good counsell we shalbe able

<p. 238

$I by good police to distr2 all the captayns and ryng_ledres
$I that be of yll and contrarij mynde; that done,
$I the other wilbe good to rule. So I tryst that we
$I shall alwayes kepe the toune and marches to the
$I kyngis use and hys." More of this touchyng this
$I last artycle was spoken, whiche is not now perfetly
$I in my remenbrans; but well I remenbre that every_man
$I named oone to ryde the wrold of, yf suche
$I daunger should come to pase, as I tryst never to se
$I by Godis grace, whoo ever preserve youre hygnes.
$I   Item, by the fayth that I bere unto my Savyour
$I Cryst Jhesu and to youre hygnes, thys byfore rehersed
$I was the sayyng of every of them as nyghe as I kan
$I call now to my remenbrans.
