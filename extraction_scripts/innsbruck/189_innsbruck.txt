$I My dutye moste humbly remembred unto your Ma_jestie.
$I It maye please the same to be advertysed that
$I I have by my servantes receaved your moste honora_ble
$I Letter, the contentes wherof doe not a litle trouble
$I me, and so much the more for that any of my servants
$I should move or attempte me in matteres towching my
$I sowle, which I thinke the meaneste subjecte within
$I your Realme could evell beare at their servantes hande;
$I havinge for my parte utterly refused heretofor to talke
$I with them in such matteres, and of all other persones
$I leaste regarded them therein; to whom I have de_clared
$I what I thinke as she which trusted that your

<p. 177

$I Majestie would have suffered me your poore humble
$I sister and beadeswoman to have used the accustomed
$I Masse, which the Kinge your father and myne with
$I all his predecessores evermore used; wherin also I have
$I been brought upp from my youth, and therunto my
$I conscyence doth not only bynde me, which by noe
$I meanes will suffer me to thinke one thing and do
$I another, but also the promise made to the Emperore
$I by your Majesties Counsell was an assurance to me
$I that in so doinge I should not offend the Lawes, al_though
$I they seeme now to quallefye and deny the
$I thing.
$I And at my laste waytinge upon your Majestie I was
$I so bould to declare my mynd and conscyence to the
$I same, and desired your Highness, rather then you
$I should constraine me to leave the Masse, to take my
$I life, whereunto your Majestie made me a very gentle
$I answere.
$I And nowe I beseche your Highnes to give me leave
$I to write what I thinke towching your Majesties Let_teres.
$I In deed they be signed with your owne hand,
$I and neverthelesse in my oppinione not your Majesties
$I in effecte, because it is well knowne (as heretofore I
$I have declared in the presence of your Highnes) that
$I althoughe, Our Lorde be praysed, your Majestie hath
$I farre more knowledge and greater guiftes then otheres
$I of your yeares, yett it is not possyble that your High_nes
$I can at theis yeares be a judge in matters of Reli_geon.

<p. 178

$I And therefore I take it that the matter in your
$I Letter procedeth from such as do wish those thinges
$I to take place, which be moste agreeable to themselves:
$I by whose doinges (your Majestie not offended) I in_tend
$I not to rule my Conscyence.
$I And thus, without molestynge your Highnes any
$I further, I humblye beseeche the same ever, for Gods
$I sake, to beare with me as you have done, and not to
$I thinke that by my doinges or ensample any inconve_nyence
$I might growe to your Majestie or your Realme;
$I for I use it not after any such soarte; puttyng no
$I doubte but in tyme to come, whether I live or die,
$I your Majestie shall perceave myne intente is grownd_ed
$I upon a true love towardes you, whose royall estate
$I I beseech Almightie God longe to contynewe, which
$I is and shalbe my daylie prayer, accordinge to my
$I dutye.
$I And after pardon craved of your Majestie for thes
$I rude and boulde Letteres, yf neither at my humble
$I suite, nor for regard of the promisse made to the Em_peror,
$I your Highnes will suffer and beare with me, as
$I you have done, tyll your Majestie may be a Judge
$I herein yourselfe, and right understand their proceed_inges,
$I (of which your goodness yet I dispaire not,)
$I otherwise, rather then to offend God and my conscy_ence
$I I offer my bodye at your will, and death shall
$I be more welcome than lyfe with a trowbeled conssy_ence

<p. 179

$I Moste humbly beseching your Majestie to pardon
$I my slowenes in answeringe your Letteres, for my
$I owlde deseasse would not suffer me to write any soner.
$I And thus I praye Almightie God to keepe your Ma_jestie
$I in alle vertue and honor, with good health and
$I longe lyfe to his pleasure. From my poore howse at
$I Copped Hall the xix of Auguste.
$I Your Majestie's moste
$I humble sistere
$I MARY.
