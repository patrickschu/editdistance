$I lasted till Saterday at fiue a clock in the morning, and yes_terday
$I was the christening of P. Will: childe: I was at the
$I supper: my Neece, the P=s= douager, the little Prince and
$I .P. Maurice were gossips: the States generall, I meane their
$I Deputies, and the Counsell of State, and myself and Louyse
$I were there as guests.    after super was dancing this (till)
$I three a clock, my little Nephue was at thesuper and sett verie
$I still all the time: those States that were there were verie
$I much taken with him.    the King of Sueden with his army
$I is within an houres going from Kunisberg with twenty
$I thousand men, most horse.   the Elector is in the toune and
$I has also which they say is twentie thousand also, he has
$I [torn off;] foot then the King has [also torn] Ambassadour
$I goe this week from hence towards Sueden and Dennemark,
$I one of those that goes for Dennemarke is Mon=r= d'Ameron
$I a gentleman of Utrecht, a verie honest and great Royalist
$I and so you may be sure my great frend, but I beleeue they
$I will doe but little with that King, for I am tolde from a
$I good hande that he and the K. of Sueden are in verie good
$I intelligence together, which I am not sorie for considering
$I how little these States assist there allies.    My deare Neece
$I continues her resolution of going from hence Thursday
$I next, but I dout the weather will hinder for it thaughs
$I apace.
$I I ame euer your most affectionat frend.
