$I MY DEAREST HEART,-I send you heer a letter that
$I will amaze you I believe as muche as it did mee, but

$I don a worse mischiefe. Rid your hands of him quickly
$I for God's sake since I knew this I have broken open his
$I boxe but found nothing there but his owne things, his new
$I sute and most of his linnen, unlesse it bee the cape of
$I your plush cloak wch I have sent lest you might want it.
