$I   My honourable and good Lord:  I have received
$I your letter even as I was weighing to go out; and
$I for the first part, I am most heartily to give your
$I Lordship thanks for your honourable favour. I will
$I acknowledge it with all my love, and ready to do
$I you any service.
$I   For Mr. Hawkyns' bargain: he is presently to
$I repair to the Court, where he shall be best able to
$I answer in his own defence; but this much I will say
$I to your Lordship: I have been aboard of every
$I ship that goeth out with me, and in every place
$I where any may creep, and I do thank God that they
$I be in the estate they be in; and there is never a one
$I of them that knows what a leak means. I have known
$I when an Admiral of England hath gone out, and two
$I ships in fleet could not say so. There is none that
$I goeth out now but I durst go to the Rio de la Plata
$I in her; and yet the Mary Rose and the Swallow
$I be with me, who were ships in the King's Majesty's
$I her father's time. And therefore I dare presume

<p. 80

$I greatly that those that have been made in her
$I Majesty's time be very good and serviceable, and
$I shall prove them arrant liars that have reported the
$I contrary. And I thank God her Majesty, I hope,
$I may be well assured of their goodness; yet every_thing
$I hath his time, and must be helped as need
$I requireth.
$I   My Lord, I had no meaning to carry away all
$I the officers. I have none with me but Sir W.
$I Wynter. I leave Mr. Hawkyns and Mr. Borough
$I behind to wait on your Lordship, and to put the
$I four great ships in readiness, which we shall greatly
$I need if the Spanish forces come out. And so, my
$I Lord, having no more leisure to write at large,
$I being under sail, I bid your Lordship most heartily
$I farewell. the 21st of February, at 12 o'clock the
$I afternoon.
$I   Your Lordship's most assured to command,
$I                                      C. HOWARD.
