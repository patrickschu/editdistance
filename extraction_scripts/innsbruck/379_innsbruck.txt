$I To my very loving friend Robert Barnard, Esquire: Present
$I                        these.
$I Sir,                       'Huntingdon,' 17th April 1643.
$I    I have received two Letters, one from my lord of
$I Manchester, the other from yourself; much to the same
$I effect: I hope therefore one answer will serve them
$I both.
$I    Which is in short this: what we know you are dis_affected
$I to the Parliament;  and truly if the Lords,
$I or any Friends, may take you off from a reasonable
$I Contribution, for my part I should be glad to be com_manded
$I to any other employment. Sir, you may, if
$I you will, "come freely into the country about your oc_casions."
$I For my part, I have  protected you in your
$I absence; and shall do so to you.
$I    This is all,  but that I am ready to serve you,
$I and rest,
$I                   Your loving friend,
$I                     OLIVER CROMWELL. 
$I    Let Barnard return, therefore; take a lower level, where
$I the ways are more sheltered in stormy weather;  and so
$I save himself, and "become Recorder after the Restoration."
$I Subtlety may deceive him; integrity never will!
