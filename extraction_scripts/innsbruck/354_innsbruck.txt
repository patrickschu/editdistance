$I MOST DEARE SlSTER,
$I NOT long since I had the happines to receve a
$I letter from you, the which I was not a little joyfull
$I of. In that I was soe far remote from you, I must
$I confess it did grieve me, in that my being was so
$I long in England; but now, since it hath pleased
$I God to bring me so far as London in my way
$I towards the Low Countries, my desier is to receve
$I your commands, for, soe soone as I can get con_venient
$I shipping, I will make all the haste over
$I that I can. Deare Sister, I must aquaint you
$I with the bissines concerning Sir Alexander Rad_cliffe
$I and my Lady; as yet I understand by them
$I how their estate is so much encombered, first by

<p. 263

$I the occasion of their debtes, and then the redeem_ing
$I of their land, the which her father mortgaged
$I unto the very dores of his house, that, until such
$I time as their own estate be settled, they saye they
$I shall not be able to establish any sartintie upon
$I me or mine; but so soone as they can take order
$I for it, which this terme they intend to do, then
$I they have both promised me seriously they will
$I not faile to performe all that they can for me.
$I For them, I wish them much happines; and I
$I must acknowledge I have bine very kindly enter_tained
$I of them both all the time of my being
$I there. Now, deare Sister, when you shall see
$I them in my absence, will you please to put them
$I in mind of me, for their intent is to see you this
$I somer. Deare Sister, I must confess that I am
$I ashamed now againe to trubble you, but my neces_sitie
$I is such, occasioned by my living and teduous
$I travels, that I must intrete you to, if you please,
$I to send me the money which is to be receved at
$I Midsomer. Were it that I did know how to help
$I myselfe, I would not bespeake one ower's time
$I that you have prefixed, but now I hope that you
$I will take me into your consideration. And thus,
$I wishing you the blessings of this life, and honor
$I hereafter, I rest,
$I Your most affectionate and truly sister ever
$I to serve you,    ANNA MEAUTYS.
$I London, April 16,1633.
