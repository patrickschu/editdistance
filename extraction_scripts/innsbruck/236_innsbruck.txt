$I      A Letter written to his wife, found with this booke after his death.
$I   The remembrance of many wrongs offered thee, and thy vnreprooued vertues,
$I adde greater sorrow to my miserable state then I can vtter or thou conceiue.
$I Neyther is it lessened by consideration of thy absence (though shame would let mee
$I hardly behold thy face), but exceedingly aggrauated for that I cannot (as I ought) to
$I thy owne selfe reconcile myselfe, that thou mightest witnesse my inward woe at this
$I instant, that haue made thee a wofull wife fo so long a time. But equal haeuen
$I hath denied that comfort, giuing, at my last neede, like succour as I haue sought all
$I my life: being in this extremitie as voyde of helpe as thou has beene of hope.
$I Reason would that, after so long waste, I should not send thee a childe to bring thee
$I greater charge: but consider hee is the fruite of thy wombe, in whose face regard not
$I the fathers so much as thy owne perfections. Hee is yet Greene, and may grow
$I strait, if he be carefully tended: otherwise apt enough (I feare me) to follow his
$I fathers folly. That I haue offended thee highly, I know; that thou canst forgette

<p. 63

$I my iniuries, I hardly beleeue: yet perswade I my selfe, if thou saw my wretched
$I estate, thou couldest not but lament it; nay, certainely I know thou wouldest. All
$I my wrongs muster themselues about me; euery euill at once plagues me. For my
$I contempt of God I am contemned of men; for my swearing and forswearing no man
$I will beleeue me; for my gluttony I suffer hunger; for my drunkennes, thirst; for
$I my adulterie, vlcerous sores. Thus God hath cast mee downe, that I might bee
$I humbled, and punished me for example of others sinne; and although he suffers me
$I in this world to perish without succour, yet trust I in the world to come to find
$I mercy, by the merits of my Sauiour, to whom I commend thee and commit my soule.
$I                          Thy repentant husband
$I                                for his disloyaltie,
$I                                           Robert Greene.
