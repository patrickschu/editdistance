$I oure Prelats, oure Judges, and lerned men, and
$I others good wise men, godly and naturall subjects, do
$I remayne fast and surelye in their Allegiance towards
$I us, redy to adventure their lives, landes, and goodes
$I for our defence, so can a greate numbre of the same
$I Nobilitie, Counsailors, and Judges truely testifye to
$I all the worlde, with savetye of their conscience, howe
$I carefully and ernestly the late King of famous memo_rye
$I our dere Cousen King Edward the Sixt from tyme
$I to tyme mentioned and provoked them partelye by per_swasion,
$I partely commandements, to have suche re_specte
$I to his succession if God shuld call him to his
$I mercye without issue, as might be the preservacion of
$I the Crowne in the hole undefyled English bloud; and
$I therfore of his owne mere motion, both by graunt of
$I his Lettres patents, and by declaration of his Will,
$I established the succession as it is declared by our Pro_clamacion.
$I And for the testimonye herof to the satis_faction
$I of suche as shall conceyve any doubt herin,
$I We understand that certen of our Nobilitie have
$I written at this present, in some parte to admonishe
$I You of your duties, and to testifie their knowledge
$I of the truethe of our tytle and right.    Wherfore we
$I leave to precede further therin, being assured in the
$I goodnes of God that your harts shalbe confirmed to
$I owe your duetye to us your soveraigne Lady, who

<p. 188

$I meane to preserve this Crowne of England in the
$I royall blound, and out of the................. of straungers
$I and papists, with the defence of all you our good sub_jects,
$I your lieves, lands, and goods, in our peace
$I agaynst the invasions and violence of all forein or in_ward
$I enemies and rebells. Yeven under our Signet
$I at our Tower of London the xvj=th=. day of July, in the
