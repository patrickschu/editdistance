$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I MY desires and intentions have bene to have
$I waighted on you long agoe, for I thought my

<p. 205

$I mother and her busines would have bene better
$I settled sooner; but all things are yet as they
$I weare, and nothing to be done about her money
$I till the King come, and till she know what to trust
$I to: so she will by noe means let me leave her.
$I I have no hope of seeing your Ladyship sud_denly,
$I except some good occasion bring you to
$I towne. Sir William Plaiter will acquaint you
$I with the busines of my Lord Banning's daughters,
$I which we thinke very good marages, and not hard
$I to be gotten by you, because you have a great
$I many frends to make way for you, as my Lord of
$I Dorset and Sir Henry German, that are nere
$I kinsmen to them. Sir Harbottle Grimston || hath a

<p. 206

$I greate deale of interest there, and will be as redee
$I to do you servis as any bodie. Thar is a report
$I my Lord of Dorchester shall marry the widow;
$I which if he doe, you will be still the stronger. If
$I this or any thing else perswade you to come to
$I towne, I think you cannot be better lodged any
$I whear then heare with this woman; and you may
$I sojorn with her, or she will provide you diet.
$I She hath made a fine lodging of the parler and
$I furnished it daintily, which you may have, and that
$I within it, and the romes over where you lay be_fore;
$I but they will not be long unlet, for theare is
$I many desires them; but, if I can possibly, I will
$I make a stay of them till I hear from you; till
$I which time, and ever, I will be
$I Yr Ladyship's most faythfull frend and humble
$I servant,   DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
$I  [1629.]
$I My mother presents her humble servis to your
$I Ladyship; so doth Mister Randolph, whoe is in danger

<p. 207

$I to become a statesman, for he will not spare any
$I frend or occasion one hower from his offis. I am
$I promised to speake with a very good cooke, that
$I served in a Lord's house ayght yeares.
