$I       Sir,
$I   I have this night, at j a clok, received your letter, which doth
$I signyfie that her majesties pleasure ys, I shuld stey my prepera_tions
$I untyll I doe speake with her. I wyll lett you knowe how
$I farr I have gonne, and than I shall obey hir majesties command_ment,
$I being knowen from you, for stey of the rest, and to undoe
$I of that ys donn, as hir wyll shalbe.
$I   First; uppon hir first order geven, both from hir self and also
$I confirmyd further by your letters by hir majesties comandment, I
$I dyspached, betwene Thursday night and yesternight iiij a cloke,
$I above ij=c= lettres to my servaunts, and sondry my frends, to prepare
$I themselves, according to the order I had my self, with all the
$I spede the(?) could possible, to serve hir majestie, under me, in the
$I Low Countreys. I am sure there be a c of these alredy delyvered,
$I and the rest wylbe before I can revoke them; having apointed
$I the xviij. and xx. of the next month for ther repayr hether with

<p. 6

$I all ther furnyture. I have since, and before I cam my self to the
$I Tower, taken upp both armours and stele saddelles, as many as
$I must cost me a good pece of money. I have sett in hand sondry
$I furnytures also for my self. I have taken upp ij or iij vessells to
$I carry away presently certen provissions, as bear and other neces_saryes,
$I which must be ther before me.
$I   And, lastly, that I am most sorry for, the states that were at
$I court cam hether to me this morning by ix a cloke, and spent ij
$I owres with me, touching my dyspach, in so much as they werr
$I reddy to knele to me for to make what hast for my none arryvall
$I on the other syde that I could possibly, yea by all perswasions
$I pressing me that I wold not stey tyll my full preparations werr
$I made, and my companyes, but to be knowen once to be aryved at
$I Mydelborow, or Flushing, with such as may sonest be reddy, for
$I by that meanes I shuld be the cause of stey of greter matters
$I than wold be wyshed thorow longer delay, for they said, it was
$I very long alredy. They offerd me with all, that many things
$I shuld be ther made reddy to receave me, even so sone as yf I
$I went within vj days I shuld be prepared for. I did, hereuppon,
$I tell them what streyt comandment I had received from hir
$I majestie to hast me over, and what good wyll they shuld now
$I fynd in me to performe the same. We agreed that I shuld send
$I som servant of myne to have ther lettres over to se all things
$I made ther reddy for me, yf I shuld followe within 14 or 15 days;
$I I dyd so, and sent D. Doyly, whome ye know, who hath ther
$I lettres, and, except my messenger find him, he ys gonn this
$I morning tyde before iij a cloke; yet have I, uppon the sight of
$I your lettre, sent one to seke him and to stey him. This farr
$I alredy have I proceded. I told the states, also, that I steyd here_about
$I tyll I shuld prepare for my owne speedyer dyspach.
$I   Whereuppon this sudden change doth groe, M=r= secretary, I

<p. 7

$I can not imagin, nether wyll I meddell withall, but must obey her
$I majesties pleasure yf she have determyned any alteration, which
$I I desyer to hear from you, for yf I com to the court yt must more
$I easyly breake out, as yt wyll notwithstanding, and I can but greve
$I at the myserable estate of the pore aflycted; as for my owne, hit
$I must be as the potters vessell, &c.
$I   For that I know this forenoon some of the estates wyll com
$I ageyn to me about this cause, I wylbe absent somwhear tyll after
$I none, by which tyme I wyll hope to receive further dyrectyon
$I from you, which God grant to be best for her majesties own
$I servyce and hir realme, by whose wysdom and government we are
$I all lyke ether to stand or faule. Thus in much hast, praing you to
$I excuse the imperfectyon of yt, being scrybled in my bed this Mon_day
$I morning almost ij a clok.
$I                                  Your assured frend,
$I                                              R. Leycester.
$I      Addressed.
$I To the right honourable
$I   M=r= secreatary Walsingham,
$I                    hast, hast,
$I                       hast.
