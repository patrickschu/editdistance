$I MADAME
$I Although the necessity of my cause (which
$I makith me to be importune to you) do make you to
$I judge that I am out of the way, yet such as have not
$I my passion, nor the respects wherof you ar perswad_ed,
$I will think that I do as my cause doth requyre.
$I Madame I have not accused you, neither in wordes
$I nor in thought, to have usid your self evell towardes
$I me; and I beleeve that you have no want of good un_derstanding
$I to keepe you from perswasion against
$I your naturall good inclynation. But in the meane
$I tyme I cannot chose (having my senses) but perceive
$I very evell furderance in my matters, sence my com_ming
$I hither. I thought that I had sufficiently discourcid
$I unto yow the discommodities which this delay bring_eth
$I unto me. And spetially, that they think in this
$I next moneth of August, to hold a Parlement against
$I me and all my servants. And in the meane tyme I
$I am stayde heere, and yet will you that I shuld put my
$I self further into your Contrey (without seeing you)
$I and remoove me further from myne: and there to do

<p. 248

$I me this dishonnor at the requestes of my Rebelles, as
$I to send Commissioners to heere theim against me, as
$I you wold do to a meane subject; and not heere me by
$I mouth. Now Madame, I have promised you to come
$I to you: and having there made my mone and com_plaint
$I of those Rebelles, and they comming thither not
$I as possessers but as subjectes to answer, I wold have
$I besought you to heere my justification of that which
$I they have faulsly set furth against me: and if I could
$I not purge myself therof, you might then discharge
$I your handes of my causes, and let me go for such as
$I I am. But to do as you say, if I wer coulpable, I
$I wold be better advised. But being not so, I cannot
$I accept this dishonnor at their handes, that being in
$I possession they will comme and accuse me before your
$I Commissioners, wherof I cannot lyke. And seeing
$I you think it to be against your honor and cousynage
$I to do otherwise, I beseech you that you will not be
$I myne enemye untill you may see how I can discharge
$I my self every waye. And to suffre me to go into
$I France where I have a dowery to mainteyn me; or
$I at the least to go into Scotland, with assurance that
$I if there come any strangers thither, I will bynd my
$I self for their retourne without any prejudice to you.
$I Or if it please you not to do thus, I protest that I
$I will not impute it to falshode if I receyve strangers
$I in my contrey, wythout makyng you any other dis_charge
$I for it. Do with my body at your will, the

<p. 249

$I honnor or blame shalbe yours.    For I had rather dy
$I heere, and that my faythfull servants may be suc_courid
$I (though  you wold not so) by strangers, then to
$I suffer theim to be utterly undon upon h.....  to re_ceyve
$I in tyme to come particuler commodite.    There
$I be many things that moove me to feare that I shall
$I have to doo in this contrey with other then with yow.
$I But forasmuch as nothing hath followed upon my last
$I mone, I hold my peace.    Happen what may happe,
$I I have as leef to abyde my fortune, as to seeke it and
$I not fynde it.   Further, it pleased you to gyve lycence
$I to my subjects to go and come.    This hath ben re_fusid
$I me by my Lord Scroope and M=r=. Knolles (as
$I they say) by your commandement, because I wold
$I not depart hence to your charge untill I had answer
$I of this Lettre; though I shewed them that yow re_quyred
$I my answer upon the two pointz conteyned in
$I your Lettre.  Th'one is (to let you breefly understand
$I them) I am come to you to make my mone to you;
$I the which being heard, I would declare unto you myne
$I innocency, and then requyre your ayde.   And for lack
$I therof I cannot but make my mone and complaint to
$I God, that I am not heard in my just quarell; and to
$I appele to other Princes to have respect therunto, as
$I my case requyreth; and to you Madame first of all,
$I when you shall have examynid your conscience be_fore
$I and have him for witnes: and th'other, which

<p. 250

$I is to come further into your Contrey, and not to come
$I to your presence : I will esteeme that as no favor, but
$I will take it for the contrary: obeying it as a thing
$I forced.
$I In the meane tyme I beseech yow to retourne to
$I me my Lord Heris, for I cannot be without him,
$I having none of my counsell heere; and also to suffre
$I me, if it please you, without further delay, to depart
$I hence, whither so ever it be, out of this Contree. I
$I am sure you will not deny me this simple request for
$I your honor's sake, seing it doth not please you to use
$I your naturall goodnes towards me otherways. And
$I seeing that of myne accord I am come hither, let me
$I depart againe with yours. And if God permit my
$I causes to succeede well, I shalbe bownd to you for it;
$I and happeninge otherwise, yet I cannot blame you.
$I As for my lord Flemin, seeing that upon my credit you
$I have suffred him to goo home to his house, I war_rant
$I you he shall passe no further, but shall retoorne
$I when it shall please you. In that you trust me I
$I will not (to dy for it) deceave you: but from Don_bertran,
$I I answer not, when my L. Flemyn shalbe in
$I the Towr; for they which ar within it wil not let to
$I receive soucours, if I do not assure theim of yours.
$I No, though you wold charge me withall. For I have
$I left them in charge to have more respect to my ser_vants
$I and to myne estat, then to my life,
$I Good suster be of an other mynde.    Wyn the

<p. 251

$I hart, and all shalbe yours, and at your command_ment.
$I I thought to satisfy you holely, if I might
$I have seene you. Alas do not as the serpent that
$I stoppeth his heering, for I am no inchanter, but your
$I suster and naturall cousyne.    If Cesar had not dis_daynid
$I to heere or reede the complaint of an adver_tiser,
$I he had not so dyed.    Why should Prince's
$I eares be stopped, seeing they are payntid so long;
$I meaning that they shuld heere all, and be well ad_vised
$I before they answer.    I am not of the nature of
$I the basilisk, and lesse of the camelions, to turne you
$I to my lykenesse: and though I shuld be so danger_ouse
$I and curst as men say, yow ar sufficiently armyd
$I with constance, and with justice, which I requyre of
$I God, who give you grace to use it well, with longe
$I and happy life.    From Carlile this v=th=. of July 1568.
$I Your good suster and cousyne
$I MARYE R.
