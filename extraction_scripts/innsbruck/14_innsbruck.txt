$I Address: A mez tres honnures meistres William Worstede, John
$I  Longham, et Meister Piers Shelton soit donne.:

$I RIGHT worthy and worshepefull seres and maistres, I recomand
$I me to yow and thank yow with al my herte of the gret tendre_nesse
$I ye lyke to have of the salvacion of my symple honeste,
$I preyng yow evermore of your good continuance. I have, after
$I the advys of your lettre, doon dwely examyned the instrument by
$I the wysest I coude fynde here, and in especial by on Maister
$I Robert Sutton, a courtezane of the court of Rome, the which is
$I the chief and most chier man with my Lord of Gloucestre and
$I his matier in the seyd court for my lady his wyff. And here
$I aunswere is that al this processe, though it were in dede proceded
$I as the instrument specifieth, is not suffisant in the lawe of Holy
$I Cherche....
$I   Myn adversarie is become bysshop of Cork in Irland, and ther
$I arn ii other persones provided to the same bysshopriche yet
$I lyvyng, beforn my seyd adversarie; and by this acceptacion of
$I this bysshopriche he hath pryved hym self of the title that he
$I claymed in Bromholm, and so adnulled the ground of his pro_cesse
$I ageyn me. And also, the tyme of his grevaunce pretendid,
$I and the tyme of his sute, he was apostata, and I trowe is yet; and
$I so unable to sue any swich processe.
$I   I purpose me to come homward be London, to lerne more in
$I this matier if I may. I prey the Holy Trinite, Lord of your cherche
$I and of alle the werld, delyvere me of my iii adversaries: of this
$I cursed bysshop for Bromholm, Aslak for Sprouston, and Julian
$I Herberd for Thornham. I have nought trespassed ageyn noon of
$I these iii, God knowith; and yet I am foule and noysyngly vexed
$I with hem to my gret unease, and al for my lordes and frendes

<p. 2

$I matieres and nought for myn owyn. I wot not whether it were
$I best, in any sermon or other audience in your cherche or elles_where,
$I to declare ought of this matier, in stoppyng of the noyse
$I that renneth in this case. I submitte me and alle this matier to
$I your good discrecion; and evere gremercy God and ye, who
$I evere have yow and me in his gracious governaunce. I suppose
$I to se yow on Palme Sunday. Writen at Leycestre the Friday the
$I thredde wyke of Lente....
$I                  Yowr man, W. PASTON
