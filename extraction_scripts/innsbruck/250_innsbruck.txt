$I           To the most honorable and honour'd
$I                  Earle of Salisbury.
$I    My most honorable lord. /
$I       May it please yo=r= Lo: to vnderstand, there hath bene no
$I Want in mee, eyther of labor or sincerity in the discharge of this
$I busines, to the satisfaction of yo=r= Lo: and the state. And wheras
$I yesterday, vpon the first Mention of it, I tooke the most ready
$I course (to my present thought) by the Venetian Ambassadors
$I Chaplin, who not only apprehended it well, but was of mind w=t=h
$I mee, that no Man of Conscience, or any indifferent Loue to his
$I Countrey would deny to doe it; and w=t=hall engaged himselfe to
$I find out one, absolute in all Numbers, for the purpose; w=c=h he
$I will'd me (before a Gent: of good Credit, who is my Testemony)
$I to signifie to yo=r= Lo: in his Name: it falls out since, that that Party
$I will not be found, (for soe he returnes answere.) Vpon w=c=h I haue
$I made attempt in other Places, but can speake w=t=h no one in
$I Person (all being eyther remoou'd, or so conceal'd, vpon this
$I present Mischeife) but by second Meanes, I haue receau'd answere
$I of doubts, and difficulties, that they will make it a Question to the
$I Archpriest, w=th= other such like suspensions: So that to tell yo=r= Lo:
$I playnly my heart, I thinke they are All fo enweau'd in it, as it will
$I make 500 Gent: lesse of the Religion w=t=hin this weeke, if they
$I carry they=r= vnderstanding about them. For my selfe, if I had bene
$I a Preist, I would haue put on wings to such an Occasion, and haue
$I thought it no aduenture, where I might haue done (besides his
$I Maiesty, and my Country) all Christianity fo good seruice. And
$I so much I haue sent to some of them. /
$I   If it shall please yo=r= Lordsh: I shall yet make farder triall, and
$I that you cannot in the meane time be prouided: I do not only w=t=h
$I all readynesse offer my seruice, but will pforme it w=t=h as much
$I integrity, as yo=r= particular Fauor, or his Maiesties right in any
$I Subiect he hath, can exact. /
$I                                 Yo=r= Ho: most perfect
$I                                   seruant and Louer
$I                                       Ben: Ionson
