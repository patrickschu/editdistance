$I To his honoured Friends, Sir William Spring and Mr. Barrow:
$I                     These present.
$I Gentlemen,       'Holland, Lincolnshire,' 28th September 1643.
$I    It hath pleased God to bring off Sir Thomas Fair_fax
$I his Horse over the river from Hull, being about
$I One-and-twenty Troops of Horse and Dragoons. The

<p. 171

$I Lincolnshire Horse laboured to hinder this work, being
$I about Thirty-four Colours of Horse and Dragoons: we
$I marched up to their landing-place, and the Lincolnshire
$I Horse retreated.
$I    After they were come over, we all marched towards
$I Holland; and when we came to our last quarter upon
$I the edge of Holland, the Enemy quartered within four
$I miles of us, and kept the field all night with his whole
$I body: his intendment, as we conceive, was to fight us;
$I  or hoping to interpose betwixt us and our retreat;
$I having received, to his Thirty-four Colours of Horse,
$I Twenty fresh Troops, ten Companies of 'Dragoons;'
$I and about a Thousand Foot, being General King's own
$I Regiment. With these he attempted our guards and
$I our quarters; and, if God had not been merciful, had
$I ruined us before we had known of it; the Five Troops
$I we set to keep the watch failing much of their duty.
$I But we got to horse; and retreated in good order, with
$I the safety of all our Horse of the Association; not
$I losing four of them that I hear of, and we got five
$I of theirs. And for this we are exceedingly bound to
$I the goodness of God, who brought our troops off with
$I so little loss.
$I    I write unto you to acquaint you with this; the
$I rather that God may be acknowledged; and that you
$I may help forward, in sending such force away unto us
$I as lie unprofitably in your country. And especially
$I that Troop of Captain Margery's, which surely would
$I not be wanting, now we so much need it!
$I    I hear there hath been much exception taken to
$I Captain Margery and his Officers, for taking of horses.
$I I am sorry you should discountenance those who (not

<p. 172

$I to make benefit to themselves, but to serve their
$I Country) are willing to venture their lives, and to
$I purchase to themselves the displeasure of bad men, that
$I they may do a Public benefit.  I undertake not to
$I justify all Captain Margery's actions: but his own con_science
$I knows whether he hath taken the horses of any
$I but Malignants;  and it were somewhat too hard to
$I put it upon the consciences of your fellow Deputy
$I Lieutenants, whether they have not freed the horses of
$I known Malignants? A fault not less, considering the
$I sad estate of this Kingdom, than to take a horse from
$I a known Honest man; the offence being against the
$I Public, which is a considerable aggravation! I know
$I not the measures everyone takes of Malignants. I
$I think it is not fit Captain Margery should be the
$I judge; but if he, in his taking of horses, hath ob_served
$I the plain character of a Malignant, and cannot
$I be charged for one horse otherwise taken,  it had
$I been better that some of the bitterness wherewith he
$I and his have been followed had been spared! The
$I horses that his Cornet Boulry took, he will put him_self
$I upon that issue for them all.
$I    If these men be accounted "troublesome to the
$I Country," I shall be glad you would send them all to
$I me. I'll bid them welcome. And when they have
$I fought for you, and endured some other difficulties of
$I war which your "honester" men will hardly bear, I
$I pray you then let them go for honest men! I protest
$I unto you, many of those men which are of your
$I Countrey's choosing, under Captain Johnson, are so far
$I from serving you, that,  were it not that I have
$I honest Troops to master them, -- although they be

<p. 173

$I well paid, yet they are so mutinous that I may justly
$I fear they would cut my throat!  Gentlemen, it may
$I be it provokes some spirits to see such plain men made
$I Captains of Horse. It had been well that men of hon_our
$I and birth had entered into these employments: 
$I but why do they not appear? Who would have hindered
$I them? But seeing it was necessary the work must go
$I on, better plain men than none;  but best to have
$I men patient of wants, faithful and conscientious in their
$I employment. And such, I hope, these will approve
$I themselves to be. Let them therefore, if I be thought
$I worthy of any favour, leave your Country with your
$I good wishes and a blessing. I am confident they will
$I be well bestowed. And I believe before it be long,
$I you will be in their debt; and then it will not be hard
$I to quit scores.
$I    What arms you can furnish them withal, I beseech
$I you do it. I have hitherto found your kindness great
$I to me:  I know not what I have done to lose it; I
$I love it so well, and price it so high, that I would do
$I my best to gain more. You have the assured affec_tion
$I of
$I             Your most humble and faithful servant,
$I                              OLIVER CROMWELL.
$I P.S.  I understand there were some exceptions
$I taken at a horse that was sent to me, which was
$I seized out of the hands of one Mr Goldsmith of Wilby.
$I If he be not by you judged a Malignant, and that you
$I do not approve of my having of the Horse, I shall as
$I willingly return him again as you shall desire. And
$I therefore, I pray you, signify your pleasure to me here_in

<p. 174

$I under your hands. Not that I would, for ten thou_sand
$I horses, have the Horse to my own private benefit,
$I saving to make use of him for the Public:  for I
$I will most gladly return the value of him to the State.
$I If the gentleman stand clear in your judgments,  I
$I beg it as a special favour that, if the Gentleman be
$I freely willing to let me have him for my money, let
$I him set his own price: I shall very justly return him
$I the money. Or if he be unwilling to part with him,
$I but keeps him for his own pleasure, be pleased to send
$I me an answer thereof: I shall instantly return him his
$I Horse; and do it with a great deal more satisfaction to
$I myself than keep him.  Therfore I beg it of you to
$I satisfy my desire in this last request; it shall exceedingly
$I oblige me to you. If you do it not, I shall rest very
$I unsatisfied, and the Horse will be a burden to me so
$I long as I shall keep him.
