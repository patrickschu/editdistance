$I   Mr secretary, as you shall shortly hear of our hole proceedinges
$I by Mr. Davyson, so must I entreat you most ernestly, even as the
$I well doing of my poore servyce here may be tendred, but spetyally
$I for the honor and servyce of hir majestie, that you wyll be meanes
$I that there may be a good quantytye of money sent over, as ther ys
$I behind of the hole some her majestie dyd sett done, as I take yt,
$I above lxx=m= li. So you wyll procure, as much as in [you] may lye,
$I that the most parte may be sent over. Hit shalbe the worst, and
$I the most, she shalbe charged with, but, at the beginning, xx=m= li.
$I shall stand in more stead than xl=m=li. iiij monthys hence, and I am
$I well perswaded, as you shall see at Mr Davysons coming, that they
$I here have good meanes to maynteyn ther warrs, and when we
$I make reconing at home of a defencyble warr, hit must be so de_fencyble,
$I as we must be able to have always vj or vij=m= men, horse
$I and footemen, to frunt the enymye, who, all this hard wether, hath
$I gon from place to place with iiij=m= footemen and xv=c= horse, and at
$I this day he kepes the fyld, and hath putt in danger iij or iiij townes
$I of great importance, as Brabee, Wenloe, Vianna, and Bomeley, as
$I also now he ys come uppon Zeland syde, and wyll doe what he
$I can to Lylle and Lyskinshook, whear ther hath byn much decay
$I of soldyer, but ther ys doing all that ys possible for defence, for
$I otherwyse we ar no way able to resist them, which they know,

<p. 65

$I and doth make them presume the more at this tyme. But the
$I states have agreed, and doe find ther ys no remedy, but we must
$I erect a camp to brydell this lyberty of the enymye, or ells he wyll
$I kepe a warr this xx yere, and make us all wery, and, this way
$I being taken, I warrant ye we wyll shortly wery him as well, and
$I yet never hazard any battell, which he wyll be as loth to come to
$I as we.
$I   I am in hope of an enterpryse to tak place shortly which ye
$I wylbe gladd to hear of. God send yt to fall out as I looke for,
$I and that ye may provyde us spedyly with a good some of money,
$I being all one to hir majestie, and I wyll undertake she shall com
$I to no furder chardge whatsoever. I wyll help to ease hir, before
$I the end, of a  good parte of this, yf she doe but contynew hir fa_vour
$I and good countenaunce to this cause only, as I trust she wyll,
$I or elles she knoweth not the lacke she wyll fynd of the frendshipp
$I of these countreys. As, uppon my honour and truth to you, they
$I were almost utterly gonn yf I had not aryved when I dyd.
$I   Thus, referring ye for the rest to Mr. Davyson at his coming, I
$I wyll take my leave, protestyng my hole care and endeavour his to
$I doe hir majestie acceptable servyce, or elles God not to lett me
$I lyve, yf otherwyse yt shuld be. In much hast this xv. of Januery,
$I                                    Your assured frend,
$I                                               R. Leycester.


<Addressed.

$I To my very honorable good frend
$I sir Francis Walsingham knight,
$I principall secretrye to her majesty.
