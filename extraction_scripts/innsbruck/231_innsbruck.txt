$I   The absence of my Lord Admiral, most gracious
$I Sovereign, hath emboldened me to put my pen to
$I the paper. On Friday last, upon good consideration,
$I we left the army of Spain so far to the northwards
$I as they could neither recover England nor Scotland.
$I And within three days after, we were entertained
$I with a great storm, considering the time of the year;
$I the which storm, in many of your judgments, hath
$I not a little annoyed the enemy's army. If the wind
$I hinder it not, I think they are forced to Denmark;
$I and that for divers causes. Certain it is that many
$I of their people were sick, and not a few killed.
$I Their ships, sails, ropes, and masts needeth great
$I reparations, for that they had all felt of your
$I Majesty's force. If your Majesty thought it meet,
$I it [would not be] amiss you sent presently to Den_mark
$I to understand the truth, and to deal with their
$I King according to your Majesty's great wisdom.
$I   I have not written this whereby your Majesty
$I should diminish any of your forces. Your Highness's
$I enemies are many; yet God hath and will hear
$I your Majesty's prayers, putting your hand to the
$I plough for the defence of his truth, as your Majesty
$I hath begun. God, for his christ's sake, bless your
$I sacred Majesty, now and ever. Written aboard your
$I Majesty's very good ship the Revenge, this 8th of
$I August, 1588.
$I                   Your Majesty's faithful vassal,
$I                                        FRA. DRAKE.
