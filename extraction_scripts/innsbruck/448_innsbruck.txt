$I           June 22. 1678
$I Gentlemen, my very worthy friends,
$I    Yesterday the Bill for burying in Woollen was reported from the
$I Committee and Ordered to be Ingrossd. The House sate the most
$I part of the Day in Committee of the Whole House upon the matters
$I of Supply which I mentioned formerly. And in conclusion they agreed
$I (not reckoning in the 200000=li= already past for the Disbanding the
$I Army) that in discharge of the 200000=li= borrowd on the Excise, and
$I of the Extraordinary Charge of the Fleet, and for the payment of
$I 40000=li= for the Princesse of Oranges Portion there should be in all
$I 414000=li= more raised. But of the way of Levying it there is yet
$I nothing resolved though severall things were propounded. To day,
$I the Bill for Wearing of Woollen and that against Papists sitting in
$I either House of Parliament were both Reported and Ordered to be
$I ingrossed. They should have went then againe into Committee about the
$I way of raising this Mony: but the Lords hauing sent down the
$I Disbanding Bill with some Amendments, diverted it. The Lords haue
$I alterd the last of June which the Commons had fixed for Disbanding
$I all the Forces except those in Flanders to the 27=th= of July & giuen
$I those in Flanders a further terme as I remember, to the 24=th= of
$I August. The Debate did principally run upon the 27=th= of July
$I & the Commons haue voted that they Disagree and haue ordered
$I a Committee to prepare Reasons of this Disagreement to be pre_sented
$I to the Lords at a Conference. They haue Resolued also to
$I sit on Munday although it be an Holy-day; being very intent to
$I dispatch all businesse as soon as possible For many Members go
$I daily away and all here are weary. In the Copy of the late Conference
$I where it speaks that the States should haue taken so much pains in
$I vaine &c: the word businesse ought to haue been Barrier. (that is
$I a ledge of Towns diuiding the French and Spaniard.) I remaine
$I Gentlemen &c:
$I                     Your most affectionate servant
$I                         Andr: Marvell.
