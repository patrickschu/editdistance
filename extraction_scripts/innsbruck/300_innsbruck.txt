$I SWEET SYSTER,
$I Love doth most perfitly shyne when it is steeled
$I in adversity. Age in thys world is of most young
$I folkes much declined. The strongest estat I stand
$I in maketh mee of no esteem, and that which I
$I profes, and cannot, without desemulacion to God
$I and the world, bee otherwise, maketh mee con_demned
$I of the most base; but our Savyor's ex_ample,
$I if I were as I shoold bee, might make mee
$I thynke myselfe to suffer for Hym that suffered for
$I us all; but my weknes is such as, were not my
$I hope in His mercye that He will not suffer mee to
$I put up with my cruell fitts, were able to distract
$I me. I protest your kind vesetacion ded much

<p. 56

$I relieve my vexed mind, which made mee apeer to
$I your L. as impotent in mynd as body, which your
$I good dysposecion I well perseved tooke commis_seracion
$I on, and made you pleased to troble your_selfe
$I to give mee comfort in desyryng mee to come
$I upon Monday, which daye or any daye I will, if
$I you pleas to send, and shall, if my fitts bee not
$I too vement, by God's gras come; but, were it your
$I pleasure, I had rather defer it till Thursdaye, but
$I that by that tyme I dought your strangers will
$I bee come, and I cannot but thynke compynyghe
$I shoold bee troblesum to you at thys tyme, if you
$I knowe any comynge. Sweet La. doo not send for
$I mee. When you come home agayne, by God's
$I gras you shall not keepe mee so long from seeing
$I you, who will ever remayn
$I Your fathfull lovyng syster fm hart, the
$I most unfortunat MARY BATHON.
$I [1618.] To my honorable lovyng syster, the La. Cornvaleys.
