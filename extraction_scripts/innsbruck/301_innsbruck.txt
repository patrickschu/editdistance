$I DEAR MADAM.
$I I send this messenger to bring me word how
$I you, Mr Bacon, & all your little ones doe, and
$I by him send my servant Fred, a sword to defend
$I him from the malice of the buckes in this their

<p. 57

$I colericke season. This monthe putts me in minde
$I to intreate the performance of your promisse for
$I som of the little white single rose rootes I saw
$I att Brome, & to chalenge Mr Bacon's promis for
$I som flowers, if about you ther be any extraordi_nary
$I ones; for I am now very busy furnishing my
$I gardens. Thus you see itt is not good being too
$I free an offerer to a free taker; but be not dis_couraged,
$I for I shall be as free a requiter when_soever
$I you shall make me know itt is in my power.
$I I can not send you much newse from hence: the
$I best is, that after many difficultis I have made an
$I end, according to my wishes, of my busness with
$I the K. & reseaved his graunt, with many excuses
$I for the delays it hath had, and so much compli_mente
$I as hath made amends; the worst, that the
$I Queen hath bled extreamly of late, whh hath
$I so weakened her as I much fear how she will
$I recover itt, for I never saw her look so danger_ously
$I ill, wch makes me oftener a courtier than I
$I intended, and, with my otherocasions, will, I
$I think, draw me to winter att London, whear I
$I should be glad to hear you minded to go. How_soever,
$I I thinke I shall invite you towards the
$I spring to do my niese an honor, if I can compose
$I things according to my wishes; an offer being
$I made me for her pleases me well, & I doubt
$I not will take effect, if her unreasonable father can
$I be brought to do what he ought, which if love

<p. 58

$I will not make him, I hope fear will prevaile : but
$I of this lett no speache passe you, because itt is
$I yett too early days; but as soone as itt is settled
$I to any certainty, & that the K. hath declared him_selffe,
$I whos work it is, you shall hear of itt more
$I perticularly from me, to whom itt will be of a
$I great deal of use & comfort, if itt pleas God to
$I prosper itt. So may He blesse all yor indevors, &
$I continue to adde to yor happiness, which is not
$I more hartily wished by any than by your most
$I affectionat & faithful freind,       L. BEDFORD.

$I More Lodge, this 4th of October [1618].
$I To my noble & dear freind the Lady Cornewallis, att Brome.
