$I thereby no advantage be taken against my presentee. I am desirous
$I to bestowe the things on Mr. Bate and therefore do desire you to
$I further my good meaninge towards him that he may enjoy the
$I same, yf by yor Counsell my presentacion be sufficient and lawfull;
$I then will I, uppon adv'tizemt given, send him one from Yorke; yf
$I other wise, I loke to be advised by you what cors is most convenient
$I herein. Thus wth my hartie comendacions I comitt you to God.
