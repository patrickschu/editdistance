$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I THERE was one question my Lady Barrington
$I asked me when she was in towne that I would de_sire
$I to be provided of answer from you for her
$I against she come. She desired to know, if Sir
$I William Curteen asked what portion you would
$I demand, what she should say. We looke for her
$I every day; and my cosin Meautys's man put me
$I in hope I should see you here between this and
$I Easter, which was very welcome newes to me. I
$I have enquired after matches in other places if this
$I should faile, but can hear of none but some of the
$I nobility, which I harkened not to, becaus I thinke
$I you desire not to match with them; yet thear was
$I one Lord whoes daughters weare so much cō_mended
$I to me that I did not absolutely denie it,
$I but thought good to let you know. It is my Lord
$I of Bridgwater; and Sir Henry St. George is he
$I propounded it, whoe is well acquainted with him,
$I and thinkes he will give six thousand pounds.

<p. 214

$I When you come I hope you will met with one to
$I your liking, which I hope will be shortly; till
$I which time, and ever, I am and will be
$I Your humble servant,
$I          DOROTHE RANDOLPH.

$I [1629.]
