$I                     Apr: 9. 70
$I Gentlemen my very worthy friends,
$I    Since my last we haue returned the bill of Commissioners to treat
$I  with the Scotch to the Lords which will undoubtedly pass. We have
$I  sent them up this morning the bill for prohibition of all forain Brandy.
$I w=ch= though it goes up so late I belieue will passe before our rising.
$I The City bill has been sent down with many alterations w=ch= yet we
$I haue gone thorough & agreed to except in one point w=ch= they will
$I certainly concurre in and may be reckond as past. The Lords haue
$I agreed with the Bill of retrospect upon Brandy to pay 8=d= since 1666.
$I The Lords haue as we heare thrown out that part of our bill for
$I shipping wherein we provided against men of warre trading in
$I merchandise. Truly in an ill season when so many merchants com_plain
$I and the Turks take prizes in our Chanell. I doubt it will hinder
$I the bill from passing with us . S=r= John Pritiman who serves for
$I Leicester was yesterday suspended from sitting the house & from
$I all privilege till he find out Humes (a most notorious fellow otherwise)
$I whom he suggested to be his meniall servant whereas he was a prisoner
$I for debt & thus by S=r= Johns procurement has escapd his Creditors.
$I The Sergeant was sent into the Speakers Chamber with the mace to
$I bring them to receiue the sentence upon his knees at the Barre. Here_upon
$I the house being disappointed (for in the mean while he was
$I escaped by the back doore) orderd that doore to be naild up for the
$I future: haue revived their votes of 63 against all paper protections,
$I against protection for any but meniall servants &c: & to day after
$I a long debate for expelling him the house haue for some good reasons
$I giuen him till the second Tuesday after our next meeting to appear.
$I When that will be is not yet evident. Some say before Midsummer
$I others toward Winter. But however I hope we shall rise on Munday
$I or at furthest Tuesday. For it is high time hauing much ado to get

<p. 105

$I forty together to make a house & when we divided about the Fee
$I farm being in all but 114. The next meeting I hope will be better
$I attended. I am
$I                        Gentlemen,
$I                          Your most affectionate serv=t=
$I                                      Andr: Marvell
