$I The Noble fauoures you haue done vs, Most worthy Lord: can
$I not be so conceald or remou'd: but that they haue broke in vpon
$I vs, euen where we lye double bound to their Comforts; Nor can
$I we doubt, but he who hath so farre, and freelie aduentur'd to the
$I reliefe of our vertue, will goe on to the vtmost release of it; And
$I though I know yo=r= Lo: hath bene far from doinge any thinge
$I herein to youre owne Ambition; yet be pleas'd to take this
$I protestation, that (Next his Maiesties fauoure) I shall not couet
$I that thinge more in the worlde, than to expresse the lastinge
$I Gratitude, I haue conceiu'd in soule towards yo=r= Lordshipp.
$I                                    Ben: Johnson.
