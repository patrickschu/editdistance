$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I I AM now, I thanke God, soe well rid of my
$I paine that I am able to give you an acount at larg
$I of all the busines you wright about; which I had
$I done sooner, but that I reseaved not your letter,
$I which I imagine should have come on Wednesday
$I or Thursday, as they use to doe. I went sins to
$I visit Mrs Dickson, and in discors fell upon the
$I ould busines; but she made answer ther was no
$I good to be done for the two elder daughters, ther
$I was now a treaty of marage betwene my Lord
$I North’s sone for one, and Sir Gervis Clifton's for

<p. 208

$I another, and the third was too young. I spake
$I with Mister Chitting about Sir Thomas Barrington’s
$I neese; he semes to thinke she is worth seven
$I thousand pounds, but he will wright to you the
$I perticulers. But I beleve my inteligens will prove
$I better then his, for my Lady Barrington, who is
$I now in town, and presents her most afectionat
$I servis to you, tould me Mr Chitting had some
$I speach with her concerning the gentlewoman, and
$I would have had her wright to you about it; to
$I which she made answer she would not propound it
$I to you, but, if upon her informacion you toke liking
$I to it, she would be redy to do you any servis, and
$I would show how glad she would be that any that
$I had relation to her might be soe happy as to come
$I under your government. I asked her what her
$I portion was: she tould me she had one thousand
$I pounds in money and a hundred pounds a year
$I land of inheritans, and they valued this at five
$I thousand pounds or therabouts. I made answer,
$I I had not heard any thing of it from you, but I
$I thought you would not aksept of soe small a por_tion
$I with any body; besides, you would rather have
$I money then land: but this I said from myself.
$I You may give what answer you please, and, if you
$I like not of it, you need retorne noe answer to Mr
$I Chitting, for I have putt off my Lady Barrington
$I from any hope of it; tharfore, if pleas you, let Mr
$I Chitting say nothing that he hath acquainted you

<p. 209

$I with it, becaus I think you will denie it, and I
$I would have nothing hinder the proseding of a bu_sines
$I which I have some hope may come to good,
$I which is this: As I was with my Lady Barrington,
$I ther came in Sir William Curtene, a Dutchman,
$I and two of his daughters, the one of which was
$I soe conveniently handsome that I wished her my
$I cosin's wife if shee had ten thousand pounds; to
$I which Lady Barrington answered, they were re_ported
$I to have so much a piece, and ther father
$I might give them more if he liked the condicions,
$I for he is very rich. I asked the lady if shee had
$I so much intrest in them as to propound such a
$I business with hope of suckses, and whether she
$I would be pleased to favor her frends soe much as
$I to doe it: to which she answered, she had some
$I power ther, and would use her best endeavors if
$I she might reseave full co(ition from me, which I
$I must first reseave from you, and so will prosede by
$I your direction. Now, to give you some acount of
$I your frends and servants here, of which my mother
$I is one that retornes you many thankes for your
$I kind wishes to her and her busines, in which yet

<p. 210

$I we can do nothing. The letter you sent my cosin
$I Meautys was unsealed. You sent three open, one
$I to him, one to Sir William Plaiters, and one to
$I me; but I delivered them to them both with my
$I own hands, and I think they both beleved I looked
$I not in them; for, if I did not, my cosin was very
$I testy at the reseaving of it, which had I known
$I I would have sealed it for him. I think he meanes
$I to come quarrell with you for it if he can find noe
$I greater matter, for he intends to come to you as
$I soon as the tearme is done. Sir William Plaiters
$I is in this towne, and hath bene ever sins he came
$I from you, but he hath bene ill of late with soare
$I eyes. And now my paper reminds me I have
$I bine so teadious to you, and bids me say noe more
$I but that I am
$I Your most loving, faithfull, & humble servant,
$I          DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
