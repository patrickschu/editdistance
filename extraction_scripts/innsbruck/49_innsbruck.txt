$I Claxton thys day, as I am informyd, and thys next weke he schal
$I be at Cossey. Whethere he wol com ferthere hyddyrward ore not

$I men seyd here on Monday that he cleymyd no tytyl to thys place.
$I They seyd there comyng was but to take owt such ryotus peple
$I as was here wythin thys place, and suche as were the Kyngys
$I felonys and indytyd and owtlawyd men; neverthelesse they wold
$I schew no warauntys wherby to take non such, thow ther had ben
$I suche here. I suppose if they myght have com in pesably they
$I wold have made another cawse of there comyng.
$I    Whan alle was doo and they scholde departe, Harlyston and
$I othere desyryd me that I schold com and se myn olde lady, and
$I sewe to my lorde, and if anythyng were amysse it schold be

$I sewe ferthere, and lete the Kynge and alle the lordys of thys londe
$I to have knowlech what hathe be don to us, if so were that the
$I deuk wolde maynten that hathe be don to us by hys servauntys,
$I if ye wolde geve me leve. I pray yow sende me worde if ye wyl
$I that I make any compleynt to the Duke or the Duchess; for as
$I it is tolde me, they know not the pleynesse that hathe ben don in
$I such thyngys as hathe ben don in here namys.
$I I schold wryght muche more to yow but for lak of leysure....
$I The Trynyte have yow in kepyng. Wretyn the Fryday next after
$I Seynt Thomas.
$I                              By yowre M. P.
