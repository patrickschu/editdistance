$I To the Hull Corporation
$I Gentlemen my very worthy friends
$I    I forgot by reason of my hast to giue you account (what doubtlesse
$I you haue known from other hands) that S=r= Rob: Sawyer hauing writ
$I a Letter to M=r= Golsbrough Clerke of the Commons to be read signifying
$I that he was by sicknesse disabled from performing his place and
$I M=r= Secretary Williamson informing the House that his M=ty= gaue them
$I leave to chuse a new Speaker, M=r= Seymor was upon Munday last chosen
$I Speaker & approved at the Lords bar by his M=ty= in the usuall manner.
$I    To day the House has not sate. Yesterday in the morning they
$I Adjourned early to giue their Committee time till three in the afternoon
$I to forme their three Adresses. It was fiue before they had finished
$I and first they reported that concerning Duke Lauderdale. The Debate
$I indured till toward nine at night. The House was twice divided.
$I 152 against 151, and then afterwards 161 against 157. whereby all the
$I words of the whole Adresse were thrown but so that there remains
$I nothing but their first naked vote. And how they will dispose now of

<p. 224

$I that is uncertaine for it being late the House Adjourned without
$I coming to any further Resolution. The apprehensions of the Hollanders
$I closing up their Peace with France do still continue and rather increase
$I then otherwise. I am Gentlemen &c:
$I                             Your most affectionate servant
$I                                   Andr: Marvell
$I    There was no counsel yesterday. So the business of Angels lights
$I is for to morrow.
