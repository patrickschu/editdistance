$I To Mayor Richardson.
$I           Westm: Dec: 18. 1660.
$I Gentlemen
$I    Since our last we haue deliuered yours to my Lord Bellasis who is
$I always very kind & ready to further you in any thing. He saith
$I Mr. Hebird hath been with him & that he gaue him advice, till
$I Mr. Stiles should be able to come to Hull, that he should continue
$I there & promised him that he will contribute what he can towards
$I his abiding with you. (My Lord Bellasis is coming down within three
$I or foure days). But indeed we perceiue that my Lord Bellasis was

<p. 12

$I very litle informed by Mr. Hebird wherein or in what way he should
$I befriend him, neither hath Mr. Hebird in all this time euer been with
$I either of us who might then have afforded our assistance. So that
$I if he faile in his businesse it must haue been by his own ill management.
$I We conceive it might be fitting for you now to be sending some answer
$I in Mr. Hilyards busines whch he is very sollicitous about. If it be
$I negative your own judgments will easily perfect it better out of that
$I matter couched in our former letter. If otherwise, it is much easyer.
$I The house hath sent up to the Lords the bill for review of the Poll &
$I the two bills for the two moitys of the Excise. But that for forain
$I & inland commoditys is not yet out of doubt with us. That for
$I 6 months assess is wellnigh finishd. And we haue given his Majesty
$I yet one months Sesse more to buy jewells for his Crown & a Jewell
$I of 1000=li= to Col: Windam who was very instrumentall in his M=tys=
$I escape. We do not perceiue but that we shall rise at our day. Here is
$I a conspiracy detected against his M=tys= person. Major White was
$I a principall in it & reveals others. Col: Overton & divers others are
$I apprehended hereupon & put in the Towr. We haue not further but
$I to remaine
$I                         Gentlemen
$I                     Your most affectionate friends & Servants
$I                                        John Ramsden,
$I                                        Andr: Marvell.
