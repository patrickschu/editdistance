$I My Lord me thinkes that I am more beholdinge
$I to the hindar part of my bed than wel dare trust the
$I forwards side of the same, and therfore sent to the
$I Levetenant and the S., as you knowe best, the Ordar
$I to defar this execution till the here furdar. And
$I that this may be done I doubte nothing, without cu_riositie
$I of my further warrant, for that ther rasche de_termination
$I upon a very unfit day was countermaun_ed
$I by your considerat admonition. The causes that
$I move me to this ar not now to be expressed, lest an ir_revocable
$I dede be in mene while committed. If the
$I wyl nides a Warrant, let this suffice, all written with
$I my none hand.
$I Your most lovinge Soveraine
$I ELIZABETH R.
