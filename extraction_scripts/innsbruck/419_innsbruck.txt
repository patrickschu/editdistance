$I good deare make hast I am as weary as a dog without

$I have hee men's his little duty and grows and thrives every
$I day. When the sun shines his mayde has him abroad to

$I deare Hearte bee sure I have a scrip by Tuesday's coach
$I and noe reproaches remember that indeed I don't deserve
$I them I thinke for I am sure I infintely love my dearest
$I dear heart and am his. D. TEMPLE.
