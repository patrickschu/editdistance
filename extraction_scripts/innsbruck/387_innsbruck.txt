$I The Queen of Bohemia to Sir Edward Nicholas.
$I Hagh, Dec:27 (1654).
$I Mr. Secretarie, since you wrote yours, I understand that
$I that arch villaine Manning has receauved his iust desert.
$I I wish all those of his cabal with him. I wish I migh=t=
$I know whome he has accused on this side the sea, to auoide
$I them, but this is onelie in case you may tell it, for I doe
$I not desire it otherwise; I haue curiositie enough to desire
$I o know the rest, but I will not desire but as you think fitt.
$I There is little news heere, the King of Sueden has a
$I sonne borne to him and has ..........and prospers exceed_inglie.
$I the K. of Poland is in Silesia, hunts and passeth

<p. 212

$I his time with little care of anie thing else, this I haue from
$I his owne resident, but I feare the Electour of Brande_bourg
$I will be in a ill condition if he doe not make an
$I agreement with the King of Sueden. it is beleeued that
$I Prince Williame will be shortlie Marschall of the Feelde:
$I those that were so much against him are not now so fierce:
$I else there is no news, onely Scone is come, and I hope all
$I will be well ended in that foolish business. I ame euer
$I Your most affectionat frend.
$I Mr. Charles Cottrell, my Lo: Wentworth, and reverent
$I Dick Harding, I cannot write to them now for lack of time.
$I I pray say the same to Mons=r= Soiret from me.
