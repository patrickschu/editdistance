$I MYMOST HONORED LADY,
$I I FIND my Lady Cornwalies in the same minde
$I still of desiring your fauor, and a willingnes to
$I haue you come up, but not to haue the King send
$I for you; but I doubt not but shee will be easilie
$I aduised to make it her sutt to you to come, that
$I you may resaue the King and Quene's promis for
$I the mony; but I persaue shee is a littell afraid
$I you should falle upon business past when you
$I shall speake with the King, not as it conserns Sr
$I Fredrick but him selfe, in the matter of his
$I iniuring you. But I shall neede say noe more of
$I anything, sins I asure myselfe you haue resaued
$I satisfacktion by Sr Fredrick; therfore I will now
$I say noe more then that which I shall euer be
$I redy to make good, which is, that
$I I am your Ladiship's faithfull frend
$I       and humble seruant,
$I          DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
$I My mother and housband present thar seruis
$I to you. Thar died of the plage but three.
$I Maye the 25 [1632].
$I To my most honored frend, the Lady Bacon, at Brome.
