$I DEARE CORNWALLIS,
$I IT is one of my misfortunes, and such a one as
$I I assure you I am very sensible of, to be thus farre
$I from you in a tyme whearein I perseave your love
$I wold have made me that to you which I as affec_tionatly
$I desier to be as to have myselfe the com_fort
$I of a freind by me, when any opresion lies
$I heavy on my hart, to whom I might trust my cares,
$I and be shuer they should not only be safely
$I lodged, but begett a desier to ease them as farre as
$I wear possible, or at leaste advise how to make
$I them lightest. I remember well what itt was you
$I feared at your last being in towne, and I am sorrier
$I then I can tell you, that ther is such a resem_blance
$I in our destines as makes you, like me, a
$I trew professer to yourselfe of ills to comme, whear_in
$I I have seldom failed. But, for all that, you
$I must not loose couradge, nor let your kind sensi_blenes,
$I which is the self-wordingest thing, make

<p. 60

$I you so unkind to yourselfe and yours as to yeald
$I up the strength of your resisting reason, and con_sent
$I to sincke under that melancoly such hear_tofore
$I unexpected distaste must needes breed in
$I you, which I grieve hartely to heare hath already
$I rought so ill effects upon your health, and so
$I strong aprehencions in your minde, though I trust
$I our good God will with a safe deliverance of a
$I happy bearth restore you the one, and, if you be
$I not wanting to yourselfe, so assist you as you
$I shall to your contentment overcomme what causes
$I the other; and which, when you have recovered
$I strengthe of body againe, if you finde to continue,
$I in my opinion you should do well to remoove
$I heather, whear you will have better meanes to
$I prevail, and shall have my servis, if you finde
$I may be fitt for you to imploye me, or shall finde
$I itt that of others of more power then my owne, by
$I declaring that I have ingaged them to take care of
$I you, may becomme of use to you in this ocacion,
$I who I dare undertake shall do itt very willingly
$I and readily, and perhaps itt wold not be to ill
$I purpos if ther be cause. I am shuer you beleeve
$I ther are not many for whom I durst ingadge my
$I word to you so freely, and therfore will easily
$I judge that I offer you the servis but of two; but if
$I those two give you not a good acount of what I
$I promis in ther names, sett it on my score as a
$I falsehoode. I should be glad you would resolve

<p. 61

$I to bringe up your children and familie, because I
$I thinke itt wold be best for them and you; but if
$I on the sodain you cannot acomodate yourselfe with
$I a convenient house for them all, if itt please you
$I to lett me have your companie heare while you
$I are provideing yourselfe with a convenient dwell_ing
$I for your hole companie, you shall do me a
$I very great pleasure, and, though my Lord should
$I be in towne, no whitt straiten me, for I can well
$I spare your wonted lodgings. Therfore, if you love
$I me, be not scrupulous to make use of them. Itt
$I is now high tyme that I acknowledge the reseit of
$I both your letters by this bearer, and withall how
$I I aprehend your kindnes so many ways expressed
$I to me in them; but no words can do itt, and
$I so I beseech you to believe, because itt is trew;
$I and, besides that, I am farre from undervaluing,
$I for misinterpret I cannot, the liberality you therein
$I have used towards me, which is much more then
$I ever I was a debtor for to any that aught itt not
$I unto me, or then I have a hart or will to accept, if
$I I durst at this tyme say I wold refuse what you
$I so presse, which your kindnes only and the know_ledge
$I of your disposicion takes off the shame I
$I have so long detained, yett I will now keepe itt in
$I my hands as you will have me; though I must
$I still as your tresurer, not as a legacy, and that you
$I will live to give me tyme when I shall leave the
$I world, [and] be wittnes I am not behind hand with

<p. 62

$I you in affection, and desier to live in your memory
$I                             be confident that ther
$I is nonne of yours to whom I will be more wanting
$I in any thing I may do for them then I wold have
$I binn to my owne if God had continued me a
$I mother; and whear as your request is in general,
$I and extends to nothing but what I hope you be_lieve
$I not so ill of me as to thinke I wold not
$I without itt have donne, and more, I beseech you, if
$I you can thinke itt to any purpos, impose something
$I more perticularly on me, for I will perform itt
$I as I desier God should have mercie on me, joy_fullie
$I I confesse in your life, but as faithfully if I
$I outlive you; which wheather I doe or not, they
$I shall be no loosers by what you have donne for
$I me, that have at the present but prayers to the
$I Almighty to repaye you with, which shall be
$I offered up with the best devocyon of
$I Your faithfully loving and thankfull friend,
$I L. BEDFORD.
$I Harington House, this 20th of Jenuary [1618-19].
$I I will, God willing, the next week send to
$I inquier of your state, of which I hope to heare
$I as I desier.
$I To my worthy and dear friend the La. Cornewallis.
