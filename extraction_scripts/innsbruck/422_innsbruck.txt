$I If Madam you dislike my payment of two letters
$I for one acuse yourselfe for beginning with one, and this
$I Towne for your being ill entertained, for if that would
$I punishe me I would write it, at least all I could get
$I brought to me, for tho' I am not sicke I have bine little
$I abroade to helpe me. Your sister will now bee satisfied
$I her intelligence was true, concerning my Lady Harvie,
$I for I suppose she knowes that she has not bine at Court
$I since the King's seeing that she tooke to herselfe repre_sented 
$I affter she had made so publicke a complaint of it
$I and now she expects some favourable expressions from
$I his Ma.=tie= to encourage her coming againe, but yet that is
$I not obtained though it has bine much endeavoured, but
$I the King being a very civill person, and she having
$I a mind to be sattisfied the busynesse will probablye be
$I don. Tis a dangerous thinge I finde for Ladyes to brage

<p. 99

$I of power in State affaires and I am confident it has
$I caused that to be don that would not have bine to any
$I other gentlewoman. Her brother is extremely concerned
$I in her disgrace wh. has bine nowe a greate while to satisfy
$I those who did not wishe her in favour. I believe nobody
$I is unwillinge she should showe herselfe in the Drawing_roome
$I , the Queene has taken no notice of this businesse
$I except very privately. She received the Portugall envoy
$I very coldly that brought the news of the young Princes
$I yet she says now the Pope has confirmed the marriage
$I she has nothing to say. She has danced country dances
$I two or three times of late -but not the King at all. The
$I Duchess of Richmond looks very well but it dos noe
$I wonders except my Lord of Brisstol's (Bristors ?) fitts
$I of the Mother wch. he has very often and weepes after
$I them licke a woman. I thinke there is noe Premier
$I Minister here nor any greate favorite, those who have
$I had most have soe still. What will be don with my Ld.
$I of Ormond is not knowne to the Vulgar but guess he
$I will goe out more than who shall come in. The Duchesse
$I is as well as is possible and has as fine a childe as ever
$I was seene. I should with greate pleasure send the
$I newes of the Queene's being towards her condition.
$I Mr. Montague goes presently my Ld. Harry Howard
$I will goe noe further than Tangiers till he knowes if
$I ... will receive him well, My Lady Devonshire was
$I used wth such great respect that day she cristened
$I the Duke's childe that it will make her live a yeare
$I the longer, she did not stirre a step but w=th= the two
$I greatest men w=th= white staffes to leade her. The
$I Kinge opened the dore for her to shorten her way
$I to the Queene w=th= whome she satt downe. Some would
$I have cryed down my Lord Newport at his first coming
$I for his Livinge, but that is soe good it canot be, there
$I is none in the Court is better. The Duke of Bucking_hame 
$I has sett up a table three dayes in a week that is
$I very fine and great, and he says shall be very constant

<p. 100

$I and orderly, if here is not toe much of this strife I
$I am mistaken, w=ch= you shall never be Madam in thinking
$I me your Lyships affectionate and very faithful Servant.
$I I present my services to yr. Brother and Sister.
