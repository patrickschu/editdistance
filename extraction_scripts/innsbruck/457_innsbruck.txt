$I Sir,
$I    I must confess I am extremely pleased I have done you
$I any service in reference to your children. But do not think
$I that those mighty thanks you heap upon me for it in your last
$I ought to make me forget the solid obligations I have to you.
$I For after all that you do or can say in magnifying this essay of
$I mine, I must consider it as but a faint offer at some kind of
$I acknowledgment for your favours; and I beseeech you to receive
$I it as such from one who wishes for nothing more than the of oppor_tunities
$I of showing how sensible he is of them. Upon this
$I confidence, and the good success you assure me our method hath
$I hitherto had, I venture to trouble you with the remainder of my
$I thoughts on that subject, and in this one more long sheet you
$I will find I am come to the end of my tether. For having con_ducted
$I my young master to the age when he will be got out of
$I the hands of masters and tutors, we are at the bounds of what is
$I [said] to concern education. I do not pretend, though I am now
$I come to the conclusion, that I have given you a just treatise
$I on this matter. There are a thousand other things that may
$I need consideration; especially if one should take in the various
$I tempers, different inclinations, and particular defaults, that are
$I to be found in children, and prescribe proper remedies to each
$I of them. But in this tumultuary draft I have made for your
$I son, I have considered him barely as white paper, as a piece of
$I wax, to be moulded and fashioned, and therefore have only
$I touched those heads, which I judged necessary to the breeding
$I of a young gentleman of his condition in general. And though
$I I have with a great deal of freedom given you my opinion con_cerning
$I all those things that came in my thoughts, and appeared
$I material, yet I am too sensible of my want of experience in this
$I affair, and the oversights I am liable to, to think that I have
$I writ approaches anything more perfect even in that kind. You
$I must not, therefore, though I am come to the end, look on it as
$I a treatise, wich I put into your hands for complete. It is well
$I if being writ (as it has been) by scraps at distant times and

<p. 160

$I places, it will hold together and be of a piece. What parts you
$I find I have either wholly omitted, or too slightly touched on,
$I I desire you to remind me of. For since I shall not scruple to
$I trouble you with anything else on this subject, which may at any
$I time hereafter come into my thoughts, you may be sure I shall
$I much more readily do so, when you shall set me on work, or
$I propose any new matter you shall find wanting, which your care
$I and concern for your dear little ones cannot (I conclude) fail to
$I suggest to you in abundance: it being a fate that usually attends
$I the speculations, which contemplative men have pleased them_selves
$I with in their studies, to be found very defective when they
$I come to be put in practice.
$I   As to remedies for peculiar disorders, the account you give
$I me of your son makes me think I shall have little to say on that
$I occasion. You will not suspect I flatter you, when I say his
$I temper is as one could wish, and the love of reason he shows in
$I his inquiries and discourses is as much to be preferred to that
$I prattling quickness, which we are apt to be delighted in with
$I children, as a healthy, well-made boy is to a gaudy suit; and if
$I it were necesssary there I think I could show you that that witty
$I pertness that appears sometimes so early proceeds from a prin_ciple
$I that seldom accompanies a strong constitution of body, or
$I ripens into a strong judgment of mind. And if you desire to
$I have him a more brisk talker, I believe I could teach you the way
$I to make him so. But I find you had rather your son should be
$I able and useful when a man, the pretty company and diversion
$I to others whilst a child, though if that, too, were to be considered,
$I I think I may say there is not so much pleasure to have a child
$I prattle agreeably as to reason well. Encourage, therfore, his
$I inquisitiveness all you can by satisfying his demands and  inform
$I his judgment as far as it is capable. When his reasons are any
$I way tolerable, let him find the credit and commendation of it.
$I and when they are quite out of the way, let him without being
$I laughed at for his mistake be gently put into the right, and can
$I take care as much as you can that in this inclination he shows to
$I reason about everything, nobody baulk or impose upon him.
$I For when we have all done, the right improvement and exercise
$I of that faculty is the highest perfection of a man, and furnishes
$I all the true light which our minds can attain unto.
$I    I have formerly mentioned ’sop's Fables, or some such other

<p. 161

$I book of pleasant stories to draw him on with delight in reading.
$I I now add that, if it be possible, you should get it with pictures,
$I which will in a temper like his (that if I mistake not is much more
$I pleased with things than names) make the learning of characters
$I and words go down much easier when he sees there is some use
$I of it, and that the knowledge of beasts and birds and such other
$I things comes along with it those visible objects children heard
$I talked of in vain and without any satisfaction whilst thet have
$I no ideas of them. If therfore ’sop's Fables, or some such other
$I book, cannot be got with pictures, yet at least get him what
$I picturs of animals you can, with the names of them, which at
$I the same time will encourage him to read, and afford him matter
$I of enquiry and knowledge.
$I    If you find it with difficulty to meet with such a tutor as we
$I desire, I do not at all wonder. I can only say, spare no care nor
$I cost to get such an one. All things are to be had that way: and
$I I dare assure you, that if you get a good one, you will never
$I repent the charge; but you will always have the satisfaction to
$I think it the money, of all others, the best laid out. But be
$I sure take nobody upon friends, or charitable, no, nor great
$I commendations. Inform yourselves throughly whether he be
$I for your purpose, and when you find him every way, so get him
$I at any rate. But whether he be such an one as I have formerly
$I mentioned, and your design will need, you alone can judge;
$I nor will the reputation of a sober man with learning enough
$I (which with others is all usually that is required in a tutor) serve
$I your turn. In this choice be as curious as you would be in that
$I of a wife for him. For you must not think of trial, or changing
$I afterwards; that will cause great inconvenience to you, and
$I greater to him. When I consider the scruples and cautions I
$I here lay in your way, methinks it looks as if I advised you to
$I something which I would have you offer at, but in effect not do.
$I but you know how much I am in earnest in this point; only you
$I will understand me aright, if you think it a business you ought to
$I be very nice in. When you have pitched on one, after having had
$I him awhile with you tell me what kind of a man he is, I will then,
$I the best I can, tell you what kind of use you are to make of him.
$I    As to the business with Stratton I have nothing to say, but
$I leave it wholly to your judgment, for so as you determine I
$I know it will be well.

$I    Present my humble service to Madam, and tell her I am glad
$I the little ones follow so well the footsteps of their mother, that
$I they begin to have a reputation so early. I wish her and them
$I health that she may long enjoy that growing satisfaction. I
$I wish you with them all happiness, and am,
$I                           Sir,
$I                                   your most humble servant,
$I                                           J.L.
$I 15th march.
