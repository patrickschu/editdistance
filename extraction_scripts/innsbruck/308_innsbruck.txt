$I                     Venice, this 3rd of February, 1619.
$I Right Honourable and my very good Lord,
$I    I am very glad of this opportunity, that by the hand of a
$I gentleman who doth so entirely honour you, both in his continual
$I speech and in his soul, I may revive also with your Lordship mine
$I own long devotion, even since the time that I did first contemplate
$I your noble virtues, when I was a poor student at Altorph; which
$I were my happiest days. For what have [I] since observed in my

$I employments but a few maxims of State too high for my capacity,
$I and too subtle for my nature, which was cast in a plainer mould?
$I Is then at least my fortune mended? Alas, my dear Lord, let me
$I not think of that. For when I consider how all those of my rank
$I have been dignified and benefited at home, while I have been

<p. 162

$I gathering of cockles upon this lake, I am in good faith impatient,
$I more of the shame, than of the sense of want. Yet this is my
$I comfort, that my gracious Master (as it hath pleased him to let me
$I know) doth love me. And for the rest, philosophy shall be my
$I reward, which, though it cannot keep me from need, yet it will
$I teach me not to envy those that abound.
$I    It was not my meaning when I took this leaf to make myself the
$I subject of my letter unto your Lordship, though the remembrance of
$I your ancient favours hath, I know not how, made my pen so
$I familiar.
$I    For the public affairs, we stand here yet very ambiguously. The
$I land was long since quiet, but the sea, as the more movable
$I element, is still in agitation; and we are artificially kept at excessive
$I charge by a mad Viceroy and a winking Pope, while the King of
$I Spayne, in the meanwhile, standeth at the benefit of time and fortune,
$I ready to authorize or disavow the event according to the success,
$I which I take to be the sum of our case. but these things will be
$I more particularly delivered to your lordship by this 'redeemed
$I Neptune', as I have baptized him: for they here think him more
$I than a man that knows so much more than themselves. And in
$I truth, if any place had been vacant worthy of his sufficiency, there
$I wanted no desire to hold him, as they have expressed by offers to
$I himself, and declared in their letters by him to their ambassador,
$I and most of all in the confident communication of their affairs and
$I desires with him, which likewise include some hope of their having
$I him again, as your Lordship will perceive by the subject of my
$I dispatch to the King, which he carrieth.
$I    I must add hereunto for mine own part that I have been glad
$I of this occasion which hath given me a better taste of him, and of
$I his fair and clear dispositions, than I could take at a transitory view
$I when I passed my last duty with your Lordship in Canterburie; and
$I I am likewise almost not sorry that I have yet not seen a letter
$I which he tells me your Lordship wrote by him unto me. For it
$I would have made me the more ashamed to have done him so little
$I service here, that had brought me such a favour, though I am other_wise
$I not poor of your Lordship's gracious lines, whereof I preserve
$I to this hour a great roll, and especially one, which I long for some
$I hour to show your Lordship, because I know in your nobleness you
$I cannot deny it, though in my meanness I could never deserve it.
$I And here I will end your lordship's trouble with my prayers to
$I our loving God for your happiness. Ever remaining,
$I           Your Lordship's with an honest heart to serve you,
$I                                      HENRY WOTTON.
