$I SWEET LADY,
$I I DESYRE much to here of your perfit recovery
$I of helth and strenth after your great payne,
$I and God send you much joye of your last sonn, and
$I no less of your first. I hard latly by Roben Corn_waleys
$I you sent to have borowed my plat, which I
$I ded fathfully offer, and such poor lynnen as I
$I hade. Because you sed nothynge, I ded put it
$I bye, and carry awaye the keys ; but, knowing mee
$I as thaye ded, thaye myght have broken up the
$I loke. I was, I protest, hartyly ayngry thaye ded
$I not; and yet, if you have any furder cause, I have
$I willed you shall have it of my fayth, and take any
$I desyre from you in such kynde, as I doo thynke
$I you love mee, otherwayes I woold not have bene
$I so bold with you as I have bene many tymes.
$I Sweet Lady, if you have cause to use it before I
$I come home, I have sent the keys by thys bearer to
$I the same purpose. I hope to bee at home the
$I latterendyng or the begynynge of thys next weeke.
$I I have had my helthe very well ever syns I came
$I hether till the last Weddensdaye; syns, I have bene very ill,
$I and am not well at thys present. God

<p. 65

$I and I beseech Almightie God send Sir Edmund
$I Bacon to escape hys peryles syknes, and you helth
$I and many years. I praye remember mee to my
$I brother Bacon and prety Frede; and so I will take
$I my leve. My syster desyrs to be remembred to
$I you and my brother, not forgettyng my littill
$I nevewe.
