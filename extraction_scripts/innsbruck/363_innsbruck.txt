$I DEERE MOTHER,
$I I HoPE you have by this time recovered the
$I werines of your jurney, and given our babs leave
$I to come to you. My Lady Nuport’s daughters' was
$I not the plague, thanks be to God! Truly, Madam,
$I I did much feare your being very wery of so long
$I and solitary a jurny; and my husband said that he
$I was sorry he was putt to ask to stay, for that case
$I staies him still in town, as he says to me, for I
$I have not as yet seen him sins that day that you
$I wente out of towne; but he on Sunday sent Mr
$I Tom Howard to me, that I would be reddy to goe,

<p. 288

$I into the beginning of the nexte weeke. I sent
$I him worde I would do what I could; but now, I
$I thinke, I shall not come so soone, because the
$I Queene is now resolved to stay hear till Michlemas,
$I and I have been some times away of late, so that I
$I shude do well to wait a fortnight or 3 weeks, and
$I besides I wod willingly know what will become of
$I my mother's appearle affair, so that I wrote to my
$I husband by this messenger not to stay for me after
$I he have dispatched his owne affayres; and when I
$I am coming down, I will beg the favor of your
$I cotche's meeting me at . . . . . . Madam, I can
$I say nothing of Sir Tho., only, as soone as you
$I were gone, he went to lead me up to your chamber,
$I and then he said to me and I to him as before, and
$I soe he went away, and I saw him noe more. Then
$I my husband and I went to bed into your bed, and
$I at nine o'clock I rose and sent for Mr Morse, who
$I read all the writings to my husband as he lay, and
$I then he sealed them, and bade Mr Morse put them
$I with the writings. I wished the fine and all had
$I bene passed, but I hope it will. The King went
$I yesterday to Tibal’s, and comes not till Saterday.
$I The Queene is much delighted with her howse.
$I Madam, I reseved, I humbly thanke you, your
$I ring by Tom Howard, and he tould me that your
$I Lap meant to goe through that night. Truly, my
$I good Mother, I very much long to hear how you

<p. 289

$I do, and how you got home; and so I hope I shall
$I by him that carries this to London. Truly,
$I Madam, I am so much bound to you for your love
$I and care of me and mine, as no creature is more;
$I therfore all I can say is so littell. But God re_warde
$I you, and I humbly besech God to bless us
$I all with His saving grace, and to give us all a
$I happie meeting. Madam,
$I Yr Lap’s true affectionat daughter
$I    and humble sarvant,
$I       ELIZA CORNWALEIS.
$I Otlands, the 11 of Julye 1637.
