$I Letter to the king.

$I Littera ambassiatorum regi de statu AcquitaniÃ¦. In Anglicis.

$I         Moost high and moost mighty Prince
$I         and oure moost doubted and dradde
$I         Souverain Lord; After the moost lowly
$I         recommendacion that we your true hum_ble
$I subgetts and servaunts may or can in any maner
$I unto your roial mageste doo or devise, please hit your
$I said roial mageste to have in knowlage that we your

<p. 187

$I said subgetts and servaunts with all our felaship in
$I good helth of body, blessed be God, cam and arrived
$I to this your noble cite of Burdeaux on Monday the
$I xvj. day of Juil, where at oure first commyng we
$I founde as sorowful a town and as gretly dismayed and
$I discoraged as any might be in th'erth, as poeuple
$I desolat and cast out of al comfort of any socour to be
$I had from your said mageste ayeinst your ennemies
$I that ben in this countrey in grete puissaunce; and
$I after deliverance made unto them of the town of
$I Tarteys have geten by assaulte the town of Saint
$I Severs; and also have wonne and subdued al the
$I cuntrey of the landes except Baion and Ax. So that
$I al that cuntrey was waxen almoost rebelle within viij.
$I dayes, as wel barons as gentils and other. And nowe
$I your said ennemies ben before the said cite of Ax,
$I holding their siege there rounde about hit in grete
$I multitude of men of armes; and another party of
$I their puissaunce under the Lord Powns and other
$I have laid siege to Sursak, which is but a day and a
$I half journey from this your cite of Burdeaux, as men
$I seyn here. And as tidings ben commen late from
$I your towne of Baion your ennemies purposen to make
$I iiij. bastilles aboute the said towne of Ax and stuff
$I theryin with iij. or iiij. m. men of armes; and the
$I remanent wol departe and besiege your said town
$I of Baion; and so they enforce theim selve in oo tyme
$I to gete both townes, and so streit to come down
$I hider and besiege this your towne of Burdeaulx.
$I Your adversaire of Fraunce and his son which calleth
$I him selve dolphin, have been and beeth in propre per_sonne
$I on the feld in all this voyage. Not oonly thees
$I grete entreprisses and the mighty puissaunce of your
$I said ennemies caused th'abaisshment of your triwe
$I pouple of this your cite of Burdeaux, but more with_oute
$I comparison the lettres whiche were sent from your
$I highnesse under your prive seel and born hider

<p. 188

$I by oon that calleth hymselve Fraunceys, whoos name in
$I dede Juon Goer, and delivered to divers estats here
$I the Sonday before our arrival, in the which Sonday
$I the said Frauncois and othere were sette on lande at
$I Castellion, and from thens rood by lande unto Bur_deaulx,
$I before our commyng, had reported and noysed
$I thorugh the cite that they sholde no succours have;
$I and, as theym semed, the letters meaned the same:
$I so that at our commyng the cite was ful of rumour
$I and of sorowe, and had noon other trust, beleve, nor
$I conceipt, but that they were abandonned and cast
$I awey for evere. But blessed be God which as we
$I beleve verrely in a good houre sent us hider for your
$I wele, Souveraine Lord, and of your countrey here, by
$I our commyng and arriveng al your cite was gretly
$I recomforted, and in especial by the comfortable re_porte
$I of your succours to be had in haste, which to
$I their grettest joye and gladnesse we shewed and de_clared
$I unto theym, after the forme of your gracious
$I lettres yeven under your signet of th'egle at your
$I castel of Windesore the xxiij. day of Juyn, and sent
$I unto us at Plymmouthe; the whiche your lettres we
$I shewed openly and radde theym before al your Counsel
$I and other estats here the Tuesday next foloweng;
$I and after their desire we dede theym to be translated
$I in to Frenish and delivered theym to the moost
$I Reverend Fader in God th'archbisshop of this cite,
$I which, the Wednesday next foloweng, making right a
$I good and a right sturing collacion in his cathedral
$I chirch radde and declared the said lettres so translated
$I openly in the pulpitte before al the pouple, rehersshing
$I the good and tendre zele that ye have to the con_servacion
$I and the wele of this your cite, and of all
$I your true subjetts in thees parties, and putting
$I theym oute of doubte of souccurs to be had in right brief
$I tyme; exciting theym furthermore and exhorting by
$I the feith and liegeaunce that they owe to your high_nesse

<p. 189

$I to do al their payne, labor, and true diligence
$I aboute the defence and sauf garde of your cite on
$I the meane tyme; and so in trouthe they have doon,
$I and do dayly in the best wise; and have fortified the
$I said cite with bulwerks, gunnes, engynes, and al other
$I necessaire abiliments in the strengest wise; and also
$I skured and pared the diches, and made their towne
$I in al parties so redy and so mighty that in our con_ceipt
$I they be grete and notable thanke worthy. And
$I for sothe, Souverain Lord, we have not cessed nor
$I cesse dayly to yeve theym comfort and courage, offer_ing
$I oureselve and our pour company to be redy at
$I al tymes to helpe theym and strength theym in as
$I muche as in us is, for the defense and saveng of the
$I cite, abiding here with theym stille: for as yet we
$I can not conceive that we shall mowe, hanging this
$I werre wel passe any ferther, after the nature and
$I qualite of our message. Wherefore, moost gracious
$I and moost Cristian Prince, we besech your high and
$I noble grace that ye wol open your ighes of pite
$I and compassion upon your true subgetts here, which
$I as nowe lyven in grete dred, and withoute that help
$I be had the rather been lyke to perisshe; and that
$I ye wol also calle unto your consideracion how this
$I your Duchie of Guienne is oon th'oldest lordship
$I longing to your coroune of Englande; and thereupon
$I of your moost merciful and pituous grace, commaunde
$I and do suche diligence be had that your succours be
$I sent in hasty tyme after the forme of your said
$I lettres, so that by negligence or delaies it comme not
$I to late, and inconvenients irrecuperable be growen the
$I meene tyme, which God defende; in suche wise also
$I that we be founde no gabbers in executing your com_maundement
$I and declaring your lettres. Also, Souve_rain
$I Lord, in taking of Saint Severs, Sir Thomas
$I Rempston your seneschal is taken prisoner and, as it
$I is said, the seel which he had and occupied under my

<p. 190

$I Lord of Huntingdon is taken also, whereof we advise
$I your highnesse to th'entent that yf your ennemies
$I wol forge or contrive any writing under the said seel
$I no credence be yeven thereunto. Maister John de
$I Batute departed hens on Saturday at noen towards
$I his cuntrey. Furthermore, Souverain Lord, before the
$I closing of thees, tidings of trouthe ben sent hider that
$I the town of Sursak, longing to the Baron of Gomonde,
$I upon the ryver of Durdon, is taken by a party of
$I your adversaires puissance, which is under the gouver_naunce
$I of the Lord Powns and other; and they nowe
$I have leyd siege to the town of Bellinder upon the
$I same ryver, longing to the Archbishop of Burdeaux,
$I which commeth nowe to your highnesse; and so they
$I purpose to subdue al the fforteresses in that party of
$I the said ryver, and passe into your cuntrey of Deux_mars
$I and to wynne hit, the siege being at Burdeaux;
$I for as for the cuntreys of Xantonge and of Madok
$I they make noon doubt with oon over ryding soon to
$I gete hit. Moost high and moost mighty Prince and
$I our moost doubted Souveraine Lord, we beseche oure
$I blessed Trinite ever to have you in His gracious
$I keping and gouvurnaunce, and to sende you as grete
$I prosperite as ever had erthly Prince, and send you
$I victory of al your ennemies. Writen at Burdeaux in
$I hast the xxiiij. day of Juyl.
$I                 Your most humble subgetts and
$I             servaunts Roos R. and Thomas Bekinton.
$I To ye King.
