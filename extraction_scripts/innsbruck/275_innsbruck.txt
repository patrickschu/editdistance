$I    M=r= Hinchlow, I builded upon y=r= promyse to my wife, neather
$I did I aquaint the company with any mony I had of yow, bicause
$I they should seek to y=u=, as I know they will, and giv you any
$I terms y=u= can desyre; if they doe not, I will bring y=u= y=r= mony,
$I for the papers and many thanks: neather will I fayle to bring
$I in the whole play next week; whearfor I pray S=r=, of all ffrynd_ship,
$I disburse one 40s., and this note shall suffice to acknowledg
$I my self indebted to y=u= with my q=r=ter's rent, 8l., for which y=u=
$I shall eather have the whole companye's bonds to pay y=u= the
$I first day of my play being playd, or the king's men shall pay
$I it y=u= and take my papers. S=r=, my credit is as deer to me now
$I as ever, and I will be as carefull of it as heartofore, or may I
$I never prosper nor myne: so, desyring this may satisfy y=u= till
$I y=u= appoynt a tyme when I shall bring y=u= the companie's bond,
$I I rest expecting y=r= no more defering me,
$I                                 ever at y=r= command,
$I                                             Rob. Daborne.
$I                                Witnes,    Moyses Bowler.
