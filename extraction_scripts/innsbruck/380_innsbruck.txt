$I 'To the Honourable the Committee at Lincoln: These.'
$I MY LORDS AND GENTELEMEN,
$I                        'Lincolnshire,' 3d May 1643.
$I    I must needs be hardly thought on; because I am
$I still the messenger of unhappy tidings and delays con_cerning

<p. 144

$I you,  though I know my heart is to assist
$I you with all expedition!
$I    My Lord Grey hath now again failed me of the
$I rendezvous at Stamford,  notwithstanding that both
$I he and I received Letters from his Excellency, com_manding
$I us both to meet, and, together with Sir John
$I Gell and the Nottingham forces, to join with you. My
$I Lord Grey sent Sir Edward Hartop to me, to let me
$I know he could not meet me at Stamford according to
$I our agreement; fearing the exposing of Leicester to the
$I forces of Mr. Hastings and some other Troops drawing
$I the way.
$I    Believe it, it were better, in my poor opinion, Lei_cester
$I were not, than that there should not be found an
$I immediate taking of the field by our forces to accom_plish
$I the common ends. Wherein I shall deal as freely
$I with him, when I meet him, as you can desire. I per_ceive
$I Ashby-de-la-Zouch sticks much with him. I have
$I offered him now another place of meeting; to come to
$I which I suppose he will not deny me; and that to be
$I tomorrow. If you shall therefore think fit to send one
$I over unto us to be with us at night,  you do not
$I know how far we may prevail with him: To draw
$I speedily to a head, with Sir John Gell and the other
$I forces, where we may all meet at a general rendezvous,
$I to the end you know of. And then you shall receive
$I full satisfaction concerning my integrity;  and if no
$I man shall help you, yet will not I be wanting to do
$I my duty, God assisting me.
$I    If we could unite those forces 'of theirs;' and with
$I them speedily make Grantham the general rendezvous,

<p. 145

$I both of yours and ours, I think it would do well. I
$I shall bend my endeavours that way. Your concurrence
$I by some able instrument to solicit this, might probably
$I exceedingly hasten it; especially having so good a
$I foundation to work upon as my Lord General's com_mands.
$I Our Norfolk forces, which will not prove so
$I many as you may imagine by six or seven hundred
$I men, will lie conveniently at Spalding; and I am con_fident,
$I be ready to meet at Grantham at the general
$I rendezvous.
$I    I have no more to trouble you; but begging of
$I God to take away the impediments that hinder our
$I conjunction, and to prosper our  designs, take leave.
$I           Your faithful servant,
$I                      OLIVER CROMWELL. 
