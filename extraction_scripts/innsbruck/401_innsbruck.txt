$I is not yett gone from Anwerp, but I hope now the

$I make himself King by force since he cannot be it other_wise
$I this is written to the P. of Torente. I doe not heare
$I that Bariere is at Bruxelles. I will tell Thom. Killegrew
$I what the King answeres. As for the Archduc he may
$I thanke God to be ridd of the Queen of Sueden, who is
$I lodged at the Count of Egmonts house in Bruxelles, where
$I she stays all winter. My Lord Norwich has got news that
$I the Archduc goes for Spaine, and Don John of Austria
$I comes in his place and marrieth the Queene of Sueden,
$I and to haue the Low Countries as the Archduc Albert,
$I but I beleeue it not: there is nothing else that I have to
$I say to you but ame euer
$I Your most affectionate friend,
