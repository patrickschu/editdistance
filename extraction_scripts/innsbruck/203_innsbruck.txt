$I To Lord Burghley:
$I   Righte honorable and my singular good Lorde. Since the
$I laste I wrate unto yowr Lordeshippe, I have not had anie
$I conveniente meanes of sending my scribbles, which humble
$I office I desire to continew, rather to obay therein yowr com_maundemente
$I then for any thinge worthe to be advertised,
$I they may happne to conteine in them. Now havinge opor_tunitie
$I by a frende of mine, who presentlie sendes his lettres
$I into Englande, I woolde not omitt this ocasion, beseechinge
$I yowr Lordeshippe rather to respecte the hartie desire to please
$I yow, then the simplenes of the contentes, better then whiche
$I yowr Lordeshippe oughte not to expecte of me. Beinge re_turned
$I owt of Italie and detained for some time withe sicknesse
$I in this cittie, yet coolde I not commaund my desire of seeinge
$I Polande whiche time notwithestandinge, I mighte perchaunce
$I have emploied in more proffitable, at leaste more pleasante
$I voiages, frome thence being of late come hether, not in very
$I good estate of boddie, I finde the affaires of this cowrte as fur
$I as I can learne to passe in ordre. The Emperour hathe at
$I lengthe obtained his longe desired truice of the greate Turke
$I for 8 yeeres, the grawnte of whiche he hathe undrestoode by a
$I courrier sente by his legier embassadowr, called Charles Rym,
$I who is now in his returne not fur hence and in his roome there
$I is allreddie at Constantinople David Ungnad. The conditions
$I of the peace are not as yet knowne, but the emperowr is
$I resolute to refuse no burdne, rather than enter in warr. He
$I dothe expecte very shortly the Turkishe embassadowr, for the
$I confirmation of the peace, who is by nation a dutche man,
$I borne in Bavier, the Turkes principall interpretour, named

<p. 101

$I amonge them Mehemet Beck. This Cowrrier hathe broughte
$I news from Constantinople that the Turkes navie is safe re_turned,
$I which he will encreace the nexte yeere withe a hundred
$I gallies for to invade Sicill. By the way Petro Portocarrero
$I Capteine of the Gollett is deceassed. Serbellone builder and
$I capteine but evill defendour of the new fort is come alive to a
$I miserable captivitie.
$I   He saiethe likewise  that there came to Constantinople adver_tisemente
$I that the Belierbei of Egipte hathe latlie overthrowne
$I in a very greate batteil, the Abissines subjectes to Pretre Jhon
$I as we call him. In my simple opinion they have bene provoked
$I by the Portugese to take this matter fur above their forces
$I uppon them, for that the Turke by the redde sea dothe greatlie
$I encroche uppon their Indian traffick. The expectation of these
$I embassadowrs will cawse the Emperowr to delay his journey to
$I Bohemia whiche notwithestandinge he muste necessarily ere it
$I be longe performe they beinge very evill contente, of his so longe
$I absence, in so muche that this yeere they have plainely refused
$I to give certaine greate summes of money, whiche heretofore
$I they had not denied. Besides that he muste please them for to
$I gett his son the crowne for althoughe he do pretende hereditary
$I succession thetyseeme they will not grawnte it any other waie
$I but in manner of election. In this meane time he hathe sente the
$I Lorde of Rosemberg a principall nobleman of Bohemia to the
$I electours of Sax and Brandenbourg, and the Lord of Arach to
$I the other 4 electours, of the Rhine, to consulte of an Imperiall
$I diett, which it is not unlikely shall be thissommer followinge,
$I wherein if it be possible, he will perswade the election of his son
$I to the kingedome of the Romaines as the tearme it. The
$I Polakes havinge appeased a greate sedition in Crackow for the
$I religion, have since deffaited twelve thowsande Tartars among
$I whiche there were 3000 Turkes, whose returne with fur greater
$I force they do daily loke for. It is thoughte they will chose an
$I other kinge  in May, allthoughe the Lithuaniens be holy againste
$I it. They have made truice with the Moscovit, who bendes his
$I forces as they say againste the kinge of Sueden for havinge burnte
$I a toune of his called Narva.
$I   Thus yowr Lordeshippe may see how bolde I am uppon yowr
$I commandement to troble yow from yowr weightie affaires, for
$I whiche cravinge pardon and good acceptacion I humblie ceasse,

<p. 102

$I beseechinge the Eternall to grawnte yow in healthe encreace of
$I all honowr.
$I   Frome Wien this 17=th= of December 1574.
$I                Yowr Lordeshippes to commaunde.
$I                                  Philippe Sidney.
$I   To the ryghte honorable and my singular [good Lord]e the
$I Lorde hyghe Treasurer.
