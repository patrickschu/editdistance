$I DEAR MADAM,
$I I WAS long in much hope that you wold have
$I held your purpos of coming to London this spring,
$I wheare I have binne constrained to be almost all
$I this tyme since your going hence; which has made
$I me the greater looser by the change of your
$I purpos, as I am much the sorrier for that losse,
$I since your want of health hath binne the occasion
$I to keep you both from hence and the More, the
$I places in this kingdom you may justlie chalendge
$I to be wellcom to while they are mine, and whear
$I you should find yourself payd with most affection,

<p. 73

$I as in all others whearsoever I am to injoye your
$I companie; which if I did not believe you wear
$I confident of, itt wold be an extreame increase of
$I misfortune to me, since you could not imagine any
$I good to be in one that should requite with less so
$I many real proofes of affection as I have reseaved
$I from you, and for which I can make no requital
$I but that of loveing you very hartely, and that I am
$I sure I doe, and doubt not of your being so as_sured;
$I after which no more is needfull to be sayd,
$I since that includes all in my power. You have
$I sent me the finest litle beaste that ever I saw,
$I whos beauty may excuse many faults, if she have
$I any. How well she will play I long to be at
$I libertie to trie; and, howsoever she proove, she shall
$I be much made of for the hands' sake she comes
$I from. Thus I am ever reseaving kindnesses from
$I you, for which I have no better retornes then
$I thankes to make; of those, dear Cornewallis,
$I reseave the affectionat one I send you, and when
$I you can find any subject to exsercise your interest
$I in me on, be not sparing to make such full trials
$I from what a hart they comm. I know you have
$I heard of the mariadge of your neise to Sir John
$I Radcliffe's son, and how slightly my Lo. of Buck_ingham
$I hath performed the protection promissed
$I to him. For the first, I assure you, your newe
$I nephew is as fine and towardly a youth as any l

<p. 74

$I know; and for the other, my Lo. Hamilton, my
$I Lo. Chamberlain, and my Lo. of Mongommery
$I have donne ther best, and will do still, to keep off
$I all the blows they can others' malice aymes at
$I her; but what the successe will be I dare not
$I promis, so strongly is the K. insensed and so
$I bitter yett in the prosecution; but I will assure
$I you, if ther wear no other ground but that of her
$I blood, itt shall make me keepe warmest in my
$I freinds desiers to save her from publick shame,
$I and I beseech you, since your own vertue exsempts
$I you from all reproch in her, be so just to yourself
$I as not to be afflicted with her danger. I can
$I wright no longer, companie interrupting me; there_fore,
$I dear madam, farewell, and love still
$I       Your most faithfull freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.
$I Harington House, in hast, this present Tuesday [1620].
$I If you deliver not my affectionat salutacions to
$I Mr Bacon and your sonne Fred, itt shall be the
$I ground of a greater quarel betwixt us then yett
$I we ever had.

$I To my dear freind the Lady Cornewallis.
