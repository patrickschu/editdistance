$I To Sir William Lockhart, our Ambassador in France
$I Whitehall, 31st August 1657.
$I SIR,
$I I have seen your last Letter to Mr. Secretary, as

<p. 144

$I also divers others; and although I have no doubt either
$I of your diligence or ability to serve us in so great a
$I Business, yet I am deeply sensible that the French
$I are very much short with us in ingenuousness and
$I performance. And that which increaseth our sense `of
$I this' is, The resolution we `for our part' had, rather
$I to overdo than to be behindhand in anything of our
$I Treaty. And although we never were so foolish `as'
$I to apprehend that the French and their interests were
$I the same with ours in all things; yet as to the Spaniard,
$I who hath been known in all ages to be the most im_placable
$I enemy that France hath,  we never could
$I doubt, before we made our Treaty, that, going upon
$I such grounds, we should have been failed `towards' as
$I we are!
$I    To talk of `giving us Garrisons' which are inland,
$I as Caution for future action; to talk of `what will be
$I done next Campaign,'  are but parcels of words for
$I children. If they will give us Garrisons, let them give
$I us Calais, Dieppe and Boulogne;  which I think
$I they will do as soon as be honest in their words in
$I giving us any one Spanish Garrison upon the coast
$I into our hands! I positively think, which I say to
$I you, they are afraid we should have any footing on
$I that side `of the Water,' though spanish.
$I    I pray you tell the Cardinal from me, That I think
$I if France desires to maintain its ground, much more
$I to get ground upon the Spaniard, the performance of
$I his Treaty with us will better do it than anything ap_pears
$I yet to me of any Design he hath!  Though
$I we cannot so well pretend to soldiery as those that are
$I with him; yet we think that, we being able by sea to

<p. 145

$I strengthen and secure his Siege, and `to' reinforce it
$I as we please by sea, and the Enemy `being' in capa_city
$I to do nothing to relieve it,  the best time to
$I besiege that Place will be now. Especially if we con_sider
$I that the French horse will be able so to ruin
$I Flanders as that no succour can be brought to relieve
$I the place; and that the French Army and our own will
$I have constant relief, as far as England and France
$I can give it, without any manner of impediment, 
$I especially considering the Dutch are now engaged so
$I much to Southward as they are.
$I    I desire you to let him know That Englishmen
$I have had so good experience of Winter expeditions,
$I they are confident, if the Spaniard shall keep the field,
$I As he cannot impede this work, so neither will he be
$I able to attack anything towards France with a pos_sibility
$I of retreat. And what do all delays signify
$I but `even this:' The giving the Spaniard opportunity
$I so much the more to reinforce himself; and the keeping
$I our men another Summer to serve the French, with_out
$I any colour of a reciprocal, or any advantage to
$I ourselves! 
$I    And therefore if this will not be listened unto, I
$I desire that things may be considered-of To give us
$I satisfaction for the great expense we have been at with
$I our Naval Forces and otherwise; which out of an
$I honourable and honest aim on our part hath been in_curred,
$I therby to answer the engagements we had
$I made. And, `in fine,' That consideration may be had

<p. 146

$I how our Men may be put into a position to be returned
$I to us;  whom we hope we shall employ to a better
$I purpose than to have them continue where they are.
$I    I desire we may know what France saith, and will
$I do, upon this point. We shall be ready still, as the
$I Lord shall asssist us, to perform what can be reasonably
$I expected on our part. And you may also let the Car_dinal
$I know father, That our intentions, as they have been,
$I will be to do all the good offices we can to pro_mote
$I the Interest common to us.
$I    Apprehending it is of moment that this Business
$I should come to you with speed and surety, we have
$I sent it by an Express.
$I                Your very loving friend,
$I                             Oliver P. 
