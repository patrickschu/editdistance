$I For Mr. Bohun.
$I 21 May 1668.
$I If it be true that wee are generally enclined to
$I covett what wee admire, I can assure you my am_bition
$I aspires not to the fame of Balzac, and there_for
$I must not thank you for entitling me to that
$I great name. I do not admire his style, nor emulate
$I the spirit of discontent which runns through all his
$I letters. There is a lucky hitt in reputation which
$I some obtaine by the deffect in their judges, rather
$I than from the greatnesse of their merit; the con_trary
$I may be instanced in Doctor Donne, who had
$I he not ben really a learned man, a libertine in witt
$I and a courtier, might have been allowed to write
$I well, but I confess in my opinion, with these quali_fications
$I be falls short in his letters of the praises
$I some give him.
$I Voiture seems to excell both in quicknesse of
$I fancy, easinesse of expression, & in a facile way of
$I insinuating that he was not ignorant of letters, an
$I advantage the Court ayre gives persons who con_verse
$I with the world as books.
$I I wonder at nothing more than at the ambition
$I of printing letters; since, if the design be to produce
$I witt and learning, there is too little scope for
$I the one, and the other may be reduced to a lesse

<p. 431

$I compasse than a sheet of gilt paper, unlesse truth
$I were more communicative. Buisinesse, love, acci_dents
$I secret displeasure, faniily intngues, generally
$I make up the body of letters, and can signifie very
$I little to any besides the persons they are addr_essed
$I to, and therefore must loose infinitely by being ex_posed
$I to the unconcerned. Without this declara_tion
$I I hope I am sufficiently secure never to runne
$I the hazard of being censured that way, since I can_not
$I suspect my friends of so much unkindnesse, nor
$I myselfe of the vanity to wish fame on so doubtfull
$I a foundation as the caprice of mankind. Do not
$I impute my silence to neglect; had you seene me
$I these tenne days continually entertaining persons of
$I different humor, age, and sence., not only at meales,
$I or afternoone, or the time of a civill visit, but from
$I morning till night, you will be assured it way im_possible
$I for me to finish these few lines sooner; so
$I often have I set pen to paper and ben taken off
$I againe, that I almost despaired to lett you know
$I my satisfaction that Jack complies so well with
$I your desires, and that I am your friend and
$I servant,
$I M. Evelyn.
