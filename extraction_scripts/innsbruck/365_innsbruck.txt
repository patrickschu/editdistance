<Brilliana Harley to Edward Harley (1638),

<Letter 12, pp. 9-11.

$I             To my deare sonne Mr. Edward Harley.
$I    Good Need  This day I reseued a letter from you, in which
$I you rwite me, that you had rwit to me the weake before; which
$I letter I haue not reseued, so that I thought it longe sence I hard
$I from you. It is my ioye that you are well, and I beceach the
$I Lord to continue your health, and aboue all to giue you that

<p. 10

$I grase in your soule which may make you haue a healthfull soule,
$I sounde without erors, actiue in all that is good, industrious in all
$I the ways in which good is to be gained. I am glad you finde a
$I wante of that ministry you did inioye: labor to keepe a fresch desire
$I affter the sincere milke of the word, and then in good time you
$I shall inioye that bllesing againe. The Lord has promised to giue
$I his spirit to his chillderen, which shall leade them in the truth.
$I Begge that bllesed Spirit, and then errors will but make the truth
$I more bright, as the foile dous a dioment. My deare Ned, as you
$I haue bine carefull to chuse your company, be so still, for piche will
$I not easely be tuched without leaufeing some spot. I had not hard of
$I Duke Roberts and my Lord Crauens being taken. I hope the news of
$I the Sweeds is not true; but in all theas things we must remember
$I the warneing, which our Sauiour has guien us, when he had toold
$I his decipels that theare must be wars and rumers of wars; (but
$I he saith, let not your harts be trubled; in my aprehention, as if
$I Christ had saide) greate trubells and wars must be, both to purg his
$I chruch of ipocrits, and that his enimies at the last may be vtterly
$I distroyed, but you my saruants be not carefull for your selfs, you
$I are my jewells, and the days of trubbell are the days when I take
$I care of jewells; and, my deare Ned, tho I fermely beleeue theare
$I will be great trubells, yet I looke with ioy beyond those days of
$I trubell, considering the glory that the Lord will bring his chruch
$I to; and happy are they that shall liue to see it, which I hope you
$I will doo. I hard that theare was a cardenalls cape brought to
$I the Custome Howes, valued at a high rate, but none would owne it;
$I and, to requete your inteligence, I let you knowe what I heare.
$I The Scoch buisness is not yet ended. Theare is lately come to the
$I court a frech duke with two or three other gentellmen or nobell
$I men, being fleed from the French king's army, for some unfiting
$I words they vsed of the French kinge. The Quene mother was
$I so transported with joy, as they say, at the sight of the quene, that
$I shee was in a trance. This day I hard it confermed from Lounddoun
$I that the Palsgrave in besceachgeing a towne in WestPhalia was

<p. 11

$I raised and most of his army defeated, and his brother taken prisner;
$I but this is our comfort, that the rod of the wicked shall not allways
$I rest on Gods peopell. I haue sent Hall purposly to see you; for
$I sence I can not speake with you, nor see you so offten as I desire,
$I I am willing to make make theas paper mesengers my depuety. I
$I hope I shall heare from you by this mesenger; I thanke God your
$I father is well, and your brother Robert has had no fitte sence you
$I went. He goos to scoule and eats his meate well; and I hope the
$I Lord will spare him. You must rwit to him; you know he is apte
$I to aprehend vnkindness. When you rwite by the carrier, rwite
$I nothing but what any may see, for many times the letters miscarry.
$I My deare Ned, you may see how willing I am to discourse with
$I you, that have spoune out my letter to this lentghe. I thanke God
$I my coold is goon. I beceach the Lord to blles you, as I desire my
$I owne soule should be bllesed:
$I       Your most affectinat mother,      BRILLIANA HARLEY.
$I    I haue sent you a cake, which I hope you will eate in mory of 
$I Bromton.
$I Bromton, Nove. 17, 1638.
