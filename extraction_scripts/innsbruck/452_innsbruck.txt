$I Aug. 22, [1680.]
$I D.S.
$I    I was very glad to receave your last Letter. God
$I hath heard our prayers & I hope will blesse you still. If

<p. 179

$I the profitts of the next yeare come not up to this I would
$I not have you discouraged, for the profitts of no practise
$I are equall or regular, & you have had some extraordinary
$I patients this year, which perhaps some yeares will not
$I afford. Now is your time to bee frugall and lay up. I
$I thought myself rich enough till my children grewe up.
$I Bee carefull of yourself and temperate that you may bee
$I able to go thorough your practise, for to attayne to the
$I getting of a thousand pounds a yeare requires no small
$I labour of body and mind, and is a life not much lesse
$I paynfull & laborious then that of the meaner sort of
$I people go thorough. When you putt out your money bee
$I well assured of the assurance & bee wise therin from
$I what your father hath suffered. It is laudable to dwell
$I handsomely, butt bee not to forward to build or sett
$I forth another mans howse, or so to fill it that it may
$I encrease the fuell, if God should please to send fire. The
$I mercifull God direct you in all. Excesse in Apparell &
$I chargeable dresses are got into the country, especially
$I among woemen: men go decently & playne enough. The
$I last Assizes there was a concourse of woemen at that they
$I call my Lords garden in Cunsford, & so richly dressed,
$I that some strangers sayd there was scarce the like to bee
$I seen at Hide park , which makes charity cold. Wee now
$I beare that this parliament shall sitt the 21 of October,
$I which will make London very full in Michaelmas terme.
$I Wee heare of 2 oestriges wch are brought from Tangier.
$I I doubt these will not bee showne at Barholomew fayre
$I where every one may see them for his money. I have
$I read all or most of Dr Love's booke which is a pretty
$I booke & gives a good account of the Lowe countrey
$I practise in that disease & hath some other observables.
$I I knew one Mr Christopher Love, sonne unto Dr Love,
$I warden of Winchester Colledge, who was an active man
$I agaynst the King in the late warres and gott a great
$I estate, butt I thinck he was fayne to fly upon the Kings
$I restauration. If the chirurgeons have made choyce of
$I new officers, 'tis probable they may agree & so you may

$I read the next Lent. The King comes to Newmarkett the
$I next moneth. A Yarmouth man told me that hee sawe
$I Dr Knights at the Bath. Perhaps hee will not bee at
$I Newmarkett. I beleeve you never sawe Madame Baxter.
$I Since Mr Cotterell & his Lady & child are with Sir W.
$I Adams they speake often of you, & all go to London at
$I Michaelmas. Mrs Dey is at my howse, butt returnes
$I with Madame Burwell. Mr Parsons his sermon is like to
$I sell well. God blesse my daughter Browne and you
$I all.
$I                                  Y.l.f.
$I                                       T.B.
$I    I have not had Mrs Feltham at any entertaine at my
$I howse because shee soone expects her husband. I heare
$I butt of a fewe East India shipps arrivall this yeare nor
$I whether they brought as many diamonds &c. as for_merly.

$I golden balls these London
