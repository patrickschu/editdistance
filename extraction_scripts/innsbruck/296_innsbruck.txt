$I Dear Madam,
$I I THINKE the tyme too long since I heard from
$I you and cannot longer rest doubtfull how you
$I and yours do, which makes me send this
$I messenger, by whom I also desier to understand
$I wheather you intend to com to London this spring
$I as I was told, which I should be extream glad
$I of, because I should the oftener and longer have
$I your Company ; but, if you do not, I have now so
$I setled those letts of my bugnesses have heatherto
$I hindred the per-formance of my promis to vissitt
$I you, as I can now, if God Almighty continue my
$I health, make good my word whensoever you
$I will after S* George's day, when the ways will
$I be fairer and the weather better for a jorney, by
$I which I promis myselfe a great deale of
$I pleasure in surveinge your good huswyfery:
$I sooner I could and wold comme to you, if you
$I wold have itt so, but that som occasions

<p. 50

$I of my owne and my freinds make me not a free
$I woeman till the K. goe to Newmarkett or Theat_ford,
$I which will not be before that tyme. Till
$I then, if ther be any thing hear whearin I may
$I serve you, lett me know itt; and if I do itt not with
$I as much care and affection as possible for a faith-
$I full friend, never beleeve again that I have any
$I treuth in me, or am worthy to bear the title of
$I your most unfainedly loveing freind, L. BEDFORD.
$I I had almost forgotten an earnest request I am
$I to make by you to Mr Bacon, but that a tricke
$I my Lo. of Arundell putt upon me yesterday to
$I the cusning me of some pictures promissed me,
$I putt me in mind of itt. I was told the last night
$I that your father in law was like to die, and that
$I he had som peeses of painting of Holben's; which I am
$I shewr, as soon as Arundell hears, he will trye
$I all means to gett: but I beseech you entreate Mr
$I Bacon, if they will be parted with to any, to lay
$I hold of them afore hand for me, who better than
$I any other I am shewr may prevale with his bro_ther,
$I to whos share I conseave they will falle ; for
$I I am a very diligent gatherer of all I can gett of
$I Holben's or any other excellent master's hand;
$I I do not care at what rate I have them for price,
$I but shall thinke itt an extraordinary favor if Mr

<p. 51

$I Bacon can procure me those, or any others, if he
$I know any such therabouts, upon any conditions;
$I whos judgement is so extraordinary good as I know
$I nonne can better tell what is worth the haveing.
$I Som of those I have, I found in obscure places,
$I and gentleman's houses, that, because they wear
$I old, made no reckoning of them; and that makes
$I me thinke itt likely that ther may yett be in divers
$I places many excellent unknown peeses, for which
$I I lay wayghte with all my freinds; and when Mr
$I Bacon coms to London, he shall see that though
$I I be but a late beginner, I have prety store of
$I choise peeses. Dear Madam, lett me hear by this
$I bearer, wheather I have not binne misinformed
$I concerning thes pictures, and if I have not, make
$I them shewr eyther for me or nobody; and be not
$I curious to thinke I may pay too much, for I had
$I rather have them then juels. If any copies of them
$I be desired, I will retorne such as he must extra-
$I ordinarily well know paintings, that shall distin-
$I guish them from the originalls.
$I To my dear and worthy friend the Lady Cornewallis.
