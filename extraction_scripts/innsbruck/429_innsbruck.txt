$I To Mr. Bohun, Fellow of New College, Oxford.
$I S=r=,
$I When I have assured you that my usuall indis_position
$I has treated me so severely this winter that I
$I have had little leasure to think of any thing but

<p. 438

$I the meanes of gaineing health and ease, I am per_swaded
$I you will excuse me if I have not decided in
 $I my thoughls which was the greatest captaine, Caesar
$I or Pompey; whether Mr. De Rosny were not
$I a great polititian, a brave soldier, and the best ser_vant
$I that ever Prince had for capacity, fidelity and
$I steadinesse, a man strangly disinterested, infinitely
$I fortunate, and every way qualified to serve such a
$I mastcr as was Henry the Great, who notwithstand_ing
$I humane frailties, way worthy to be faithfully
$I dealt with, since be knew how to judge and to re_ward.
$I But why do we allwayes look back into
$I times past? wee may not reproch our owne, since
$I heere is at this present a scene for galantrie and
$I merit, and whilst wee may hope, wee must not con_demne.
$I Should I tell you how full of sorrow I
$I have ben for the losse of Dr. Bretton, you only
$I would blame me; after death flattery ceases, there_fore
$I you may beleeve there was some cause to la_ment
$I when thousands of weeping eyes witnessed
$I the affliction their soule were in; one would have
$I imagined every one in this parish had lost a father,
$I brother, or husband, so great was the bewailing;
$I and in earnest it dos appeare there never was a bet_ter
$I nor a more worthy man. Such was his temper,
$I prudence, charity., and good conduct, that he gained
$I the weake and preserved the wise. The sudenesse

<p. 439

$I of his death was a surprise only to his friends; as
$I for himselfe it might be looked upon as a deliver_ance
$I from paine, the effect of sicknesse, and I am
$I allmost perswaded God snatched him from us, least
$I he might have ben prevailed with by  the number
$I of petitions to have left him still amongst us. If
$I you suspect kindness in me makes me speake too
$I much, Doctor Parr is a person against whome
$I you cannot object; it was he, who preached the fu_nerall
$I sermon, and as an effect of truth as well as
$I eloquence he himselfe could not  forbeare weeping
$I in the pulpit. It was his owne expression that there
$I were 3 for whome he had infinitly greeved, the mar_tyred
$I King, my Lord Primate, and Doctor Bretton;
$I and as a confirmation of the right that was done
$I him in that oration, there was not a drie eye nor a
$I dissenting person. But of this no more,
$I M. Evelyn.
$I Sayes-Court, 2Â° March 1671-2.
