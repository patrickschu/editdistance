$I The greatest treasur vnder ye sunn (which is)
$I the loue of God, the peace of consince and joy in
$I the Holy Ghost, be wth you to yor eternall comfort.
$I MY GOOD LA.
$I I DO percive that the olde proverbis be not
$I alwaies trewe, for I do fynde y' the absence of my
$I Nath. doth brede in me the more continuall re_embrance
$I of hym: and I cannot thinke of hym
$I but I must do the lyke of yor LaPP.who I knowe
$I is lodged in the principall pt of his hart. But
$I how you stande affected vnto hym I knowe not,

<p. 12

$I otherwise then his resolution to travill makith me
$I to suspect it. But, howsoever, I do and ever shall
$I loue you vnfainedly and most deerly in the Lorde,
$I and ame and shal be alwaies redy to do any
$I kindness or servis that one Christian freind may
$I perform vnto another. And I wishe from my hart
$I that I wear abill to obtain you to my selfe as my
$I owne, if I myght be so happy. But what I can_not
$I have by alliance, you shall have by Christian
$I bande. And I wishe my sonnes estate wear awn_swerable
$I to yor content. In shorte, I hope to
$I enioy you as I would; for a trewer husband, and
$I on that louved you better, shall you never have.
$I But I comend hym and you bothe vnto the dis_posing
$I of Almighty God, who sitteth in ye heavens
$I and oderth althings in this wicked world for the
$I good of his children and for the distruction of his
$I enimies, howsoever for a tyme thay seeme to
$I flourishe. To this merciful God I comend yor
$I LaPP. wth my littill swete cosen yor prety sonn;
$I and do rest,
$I Ever yors,
$I ANNE BACON.

$I Culford, ye 22 of Octobr ao 1613.
$I To my very nobill good freind the Lady Cornwallis, at Mrs Cooke
$I hir howse, neer to the Earle of Northampton's howse by Charinge
$I Crosse.
