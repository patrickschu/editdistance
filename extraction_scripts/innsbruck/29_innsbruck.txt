$I In Anglicis litera Regi per Ambassiatores missa
$I de misero statu AcquitanniÃ¦.

$I         Moost Christian and moost gracious Prince,
$I       oure moost dred Souverain Lord: After our
$I       moost humble recommendacion, please hit
$I       your high and noble grace, as for tidings
$I       from this your cuntrey of Guienne, to
$I wete, that after your adversary of France had taken

<p. 213

$I your town of Saint Sever and your cite of Ax,
$I and putt under his obeissaunce the cuntrey of the
$I Lawndes, he drew hym down towards this your cite
$I of Burdeaux, by the ryver of Garon, where in right
$I brief tyme he hath geten and taken the townes and
$I castles and forteresses whoos names be specified in
$I the cedule her enclosed. And after that he had the
$I towne of Marmande, he abode there with right litel
$I puissance iij. weks and more; so that by all lyklyhode
$I yf any stuf or pouaire of Englissh pouple had be
$I here, he might never have had escaped by reason
$I untaken. And sithens he hath of newe encrested his
$I armee, and after that sieged and taken your town
$I and castel of Mavesyn, and upon that the iij. day of
$I this present moneth he leied siege to your town and
$I castel of Rieul, which is but vij. leucks from this
$I your cite of Burd', the whiche town he gate with a saulte
$I the viij. day of this same moneth, and slewe therin
$I muche pouple. Nevertheles the castel holdeth as yet,
$I and within hit for lak of other help there ben of our
$I felawship al such as we might spare: God send hem
$I comfort and more help be tyme. After this he pur_poseth,
$I as mey seym, to besiege the townes of Saint
$I Makery, Cadiliac, and Rious; and he holdeth hym
$I sure to get theym al by sault in right brief tyme,
$I and than all is Frenissh, and by the said ryver unto
$I the yatis of this your cite. Also please it your roial Ma_geste
$I furthermore to knowe that after that your said
$I cite of Ax and your town of Saint Sever were nowe
$I late reduct to your obeissance, as we suppose ye have
$I wel had in knowlage by such passagis as have comme
$I fro your towne of Bayon, for as from hens sithen the
$I departing of th'archbisshop of Burdeux went never
$I passage; nor unto this tyme was no maner of navir
$I for to passe inne. Your said adversarie hath com_maunded
$I th'erl of Fux to leye newe siege to yowr
$I said town and cite of Saint Sever and Ax. The which

<p. 214

$I Erl, as is do us to understande by lettres sent hider
$I for succurs from the said town of Saint Sever, hath
$I disposed hit to besiege hit; and as we trowe he hath
$I leied the siege before this. And here may be had no
$I comfort of succours to helpe theym with, for we have
$I not wherewith to help our selve, the which causeth
$I grete hevynesse, desolacion, and sorowe amongis al your
$I pouple here, seing that after promisse of succours de_clared
$I unto theym by your commaundement is passed
$I so longe a tyme and no comfort commeth, not so
$I much in al this tyme as oon balanger to revive their
$I herts, and putt theym in good trust and hope of
$I comfort. Truly in conceipt of your true men here a
$I lytel nombre of good men sent hider by tyme as hit
$I was promissed mought have kept your cuntrey from
$I this grete hurt; which xx=m=. li. wol not nowe by many
$I dayes lightly recovere; and yet furthermore, yf your
$I merchaunts had be souffred to passe hider for the
$I vintaige in suche tyme as they have be accustumed
$I in yers before, doubtles your ennemies wold not have
$I abiden to do this grete harme that they have doon and
$I dayly doth. God send us hasty tidings for comfort of
$I your pouple here, which in trouth, as in our opinion,
$I stode never so dismaied before this tyme. By thees
$I tidings, moost gracious souverain lord, ye may clierly
$I understande howe the weyes of our message been em_peched
$I and forbarred; and as Maister John de Batute
$I hath writen unto us, your said adversary by no man_ner
$I of meen may be induced to graunte us his lettres
$I of saufcondeuct; and so hit is not seyn unto us pos_sible
$I as yet in any maner of wise to passe upward in
$I surte of our personnes. Wherefore please hit your high
$I and noble grace to late us have knowlage of your
$I gracious pleasir in this behalve, and howe ye wol we
$I shal be furthermore gouverned and demeaned. Over
$I this at the request of your counseil here and for our
$I true acquittaile we avis as we dare your Highnesse,

<p. 215

$I for the wele of you and of this your cuntrey here, not
$I lightly to passe upon suche graunts of your demaynnes
$I or of other lands, rents, or revenues here, as peraventure
$I shall be axed of your said Highnesse, but that hit
$I please your Mageste t'abide the advisment of your said
$I counseille, which purposen by commune and mure de_liberacion
$I t'acertaine your said Mageste of such incon_venients
$I as by suche graunts have growen herbefore,
$I and in what wise they may for your wele be eschewed
$I hereafter. Moost blessed Souverain Lord, we have right
$I nowe received lettres from the Lord de Gramond, writen
$I at Ax the ixth day of this moneth, declaring that the
$I said towne of Saint Sever hath appointed with the said
$I Erl to be Frenish on lesse than they be reskued within
$I a moneth. Please hit furthermore your Highnesse to
$I knowe that Sir Robert Clyfton, Knight, late your cone_stable
$I of your castel of Burd', is to God passed the iij.
$I day of this moneth; so hit is right expedient for your
$I wele in hasty tyme to purveye an other souffisant
$I officer in that behalve. Most Christian, etc. Writen
$I at Burd', the xviij. day of October.
$I                                      Roos R.
$I                                      T. B.
$I To the King our Souverain Lord.
