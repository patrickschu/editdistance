$I   "To the Worthiest Lady Mistress Magdalen Herbert.
$I   "MADAM,  Every excuse hath in it somewhat of
$I accusation; and since I am innocent, and yet must excuse,
$I how shall I do for that part of accusing? By my troth,
$I as desperate and perplexed men grow from thence bold,
$I so must I take the boldness of accusing you, who would
$I draw so dark a curtain betwixt me and your purposes, as
$I that I had no glimmering, neither of your goings, nor the
$I way which my letters might haunt. yet have I given this
$I licence to travel, but I know not whither, nor it. It is
$I therefore rather a pinnace to discover; and the entire

<p. 165

$I colony of letters, of hundreds an fifties, must follow;
$I whose employment is more honourable than that which
$I our State meditates to Virginia, because you are worthier
$I than all of that country, of which that is a wretched inch;
$I for you have better treasure, and a harmlessness. If this
$I sound like a flattery, tear it out. I am to my letters as
$I rigid as a Puritan, as Caesar was to his wife. I can as ill
$I endure a suspicion and misinterpretable word as a fault.
$I But remember that nothing is flattery which the speaker
$I believes; and of the grossest flattery there is this good
$I use,that they tell us what we should be. But, madam,
$I you are beyond instruction, and therefore there can belong
$I to you only praises; of which, though you be no good
$I hearer, yet allow all my letters leave to have in them one
$I part of it, which is thankfulness towards you.  Your un_worthiest
$I servant, except your accepting have mended him,
$I                                          John Donne.
$I "Micham, July 11, 1607."
