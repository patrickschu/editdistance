$I    Master Moore, I commende me hartely vnto you, and
$I right ioiesly and glad I am to vnderstonde, howe most consolingely,
$I and with what reuerence, humilite and devocion the Kingis High_nes
$I receyved the holy Jubile, to the gret merite, as I trust in God,
$I of his Grace, and to the most holy, religiouse and honorable ex_ample,
$I comfort and reioyse aswel of al those that wer present at
$I the beholding and doing therof, as to al other his subgettis. And
$I semblably glad I am that his Grace, like a most kind and gracious
$I prince and master, tendering moore the helth of his seruauntis,
$I officers and ministres thenne his owne priuate and particuler
$I profit, is contented by your good meditation, to adiourne the terme,
$I which vndowtedly is not oonly to the comfort of al such as shuld
$I attende therat, but also the Kingis Grace haue goten therby many
$I prayers, gret and most humble thankis [for] the same. And ther
$I shal noo losse nor hindraunce to his affayres ensue therby.
$I    Ye shal also aduertise the Kingis Grace, howe Monsieur John
$I Joachim hath been with me, and communicate such newes as
$I be wryten vnto the President and him in cyphres sent owt of
$I Fraunce, wherby doth appere that, by reason of th'Emperors high
$I demaundis, the French Kingis deliueraunce is not like to be soo
$I sone as the President reported vnto the King at his being here,
$I for nowe th'Emperor, perceyving that the French King is owt
$I of parel of deth, and perfitely recouered requireth the hol Duchie
$I of Burgon, the same to be holden of th'Empire, all Picardye, and
$I other placis on this side the water of Somme, with discharge.
