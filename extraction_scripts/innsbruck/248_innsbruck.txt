$I    Most worthely honor'd,
$I      For mee not to solicite or calle you to succoure in a tyme
$I of such neede, were no lesse a sinne of dispaire, than a neglect of
$I youre honor; Yo=r= Power, youre Place, and readinesse to do good
$I inuite mee; and myne owne cause (which shall neuer discreditt
$I the least of yo=r= fauours) is a mayne encouragement; if I lay here
$I on my desert, I should be the more backward to importune you;
$I but as it is (Most worthy Earle) our offence beinge our misfortune,
$I not our malice; I challenge yo=r= ayde, as to the common defence
$I of Vertue; But more peculiarlye to mee, who haue always in hart
$I so perticularly honr'd you. I know it is now no Tyme to boast
$I affections, least while I sue for fauours I should be thought to buy
$I them; But if the future seruices of a man so remou'd to you, and
$I low in Meritt, may aspire any place in yo=r= Thoughts, let it lye vpon
$I the forfayture of my humanitie, if I omitt the least occasion to
$I expresse them. And so not doubtinge of your Noble endeuors,
$I to reflect his Maiesties most repented on oure partes & sorrow'd
$I for displeasure. I commytt my fortune, reputation, and Innocence
$I into youre most happie handes, and reiterated protestation of being
$I euer most gratefull.
$I                                          Ben: Johnson.
