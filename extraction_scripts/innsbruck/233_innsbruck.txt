$I     Most Honourable:  The sudden sending for of
$I my very good Lord, my Lord Admiral, hath caused
$I me to scribble these few lines. First most humbly
$I beseeching your Honour to deliver this letter unto
$I her Majesty as a testification of my Lord Amiral's
$I most honourable using of me in this action, where
$I it hath pleased his good Lordship to accept of that
$I which I have sometimes spoken, and commended
$I that little service which I was able, much better
$I than in either of them both I was able to deserve.
$I Wherein, if I have not performed as much as was
$I looked for, yet I persuade myself his good Lordship
$I will confess I have been dutiful.
$I   Touching any other causes that either hath been
$I done or is to be done, let me pray pardon of your
$I Honour, for I assure your Honour that my Lord
$I Admiral hath so sufficiently instructed himself daily,
$I as I faithfully believe his good Lordship will
$I thoroughly satisfy her Majesty and your Honours
$I what is now best to be done. Thus humbly taking
$I my leave, I beseech God to bless the work of her
$I Majesty's hands always. Written aboard her
$I Majesty's good ship the Revenge, at midnight, this
$I 11th of August, 1588.
$I   Your Honour's faithfully to be commanded,
$I                                     FRA. DRAKE.
