$I Gentlemen my very worthy friends,
$I    The house of Commons, not having the Chancellor's Speech that
$I day printed or written, sate (I meane yesterday) not long, nor did
$I much worke. The Bill for incouragement of the woollen manufacture,
$I which was in progresse last Session, was read the first time. They also
$I appointed a Committee to bring in a Bill or Bills to hinder the growth
$I of Popery. Also a Committee to inspect the Laws concerning the
$I Poore in order to rectify them. Severall things of the like publick and
$I good intention were set on foot againe which I shall be glad to see come
$I to perfection. To day (which was intended though not ordered for
$I consideration of his Majestyes and the Chancelors speech) but the
$I morning being most part spent before the Speeches were published,
$I there was a Motion made for an humble Addresse to his Majesty to
$I know of him the State of Affairs as they now stand in relation to War
$I or Peace: and that if his Majesty shall thinke fit to enter into a Warre
$I with the French King, with the Assistance of the Emperour and such
$I other Princes and States as shall come into the Confederacy, this
$I House will support and assist his Majesty in the carrying on the Warre.
$I This debate tooke up the whole day forasmuch as some counted this
$I Adresse to be unseasonable when it appeard that all things abroad
$I were so disposed toward a Peace; Some thought it more requisite to
$I proceed first of all to the disbanding of the Army; others, that it
$I were best to lay by all apprehensions and jealousyes & to furnish

<p. 227

$I the King with mony, leaving the rest to his M=tyes= discretion. In
$I this variety of opinions the House came about foure a clock to a
$I Question of Adjourning the Debate w=ch= was carryed in the Affirmatiue
$I by 195 against 176. In generall what I learne by information both
$I within and without doors is that both Holland & Spaine appeare
$I to be agreed upon termes with France. I have inclosed the Speeches.
$I I remaine Gentlemen &c:
$I                             Your most affectionate servant
$I                                   Andr: Marvell.
