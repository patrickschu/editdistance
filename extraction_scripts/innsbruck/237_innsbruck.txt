$I GOD comfort you, my Lord, when you woold as it
$I pleased your Lordship to comfort my daunted spiritts
$I which were so changed therby and sturred upp by
$I your Lordships so honorable most kynde and unloked 
$I for visitacion, as turned melancoly into a sanguin. My 
$I Lord in trawth I am weak.    Heat in the forpart of 
$I my hed unfaynedly, with shooting payen, and swimm_ing
$I brayne, maketh me, on my fayth, to feare a so_dayne
$I death, like to the Erle Dorset.   Suer I am that
$I I slepe litle, eate less, nor drank a draught of ale, bere, 
$I or wyne sins my comming to Windsor, but water and
$I limmons, by phisitions advise.    But in trawth I had 
$I clymed up and stoode from your Lordship's comming 
$I in, to your going owt, which made me faynt and sweat
$I truly.    Thus muche have I troobled your Lordship 
$I becawse I woold not willingly deserve to be thought a 
$I dissembler or ipperitt.    Becawse I here your Lord_ship
$I meaneth to be gon early in the morning, I am 
$I bowld to send your pale thin cheecks a comfortable 
$I litle breckfast agaynst the contagion of this tyme.

<p. 41

$I God bless yow, with the continuance of all helth and
$I happiness as I woold to myself unfaynedly. 
$I Your Lordships owld Awnt, of compleate 
$I lxviij yeres, that will pray for your long lyfe
$I ELIZABETH RUSSELL, douager.
