$I Amonge your manie studies my deare Brother and
$I Coson, I would Isocrates noble lesson weare not for_gotten,
$I that wills the Emperor his suvorain to make
$I his words of more accompt then other men theare
$I othes, as metest enseignes to showe the truest bage of
$I a Princes armes. It moveth me much to move you,
$I whan I behold how diversely sondrie wicked pathes,
$I and, like all evill illusions, wrapped under the cloke of
$I your best safety, endanger your state and best good.
$I How maie yt be that yow can suppose an honorabele
$I awneswere maie be made me when all your doings
$I gainesaie your former vowes. You deale not with one
$I whose experience can take drosse for good paiments,
$I nor one that esily will be beguiled. No, No, I mind to
$I sett to schoole your craftiest counsiler. I am sorie to
$I se you bent to wrong youre selfe in thinking to wronge
$I others; yea thos which if thay had not even than taken
$I opertunitie to lett a ruin that was newly begon, that
$I plott would have perilled you more than a thowsand
$I of such mene lives be worth, that perswade you to
$I vouche such deades to deserve a sawles pardon. Why

<p. 295

$I doe you forgett what you write to myselfe with your
$I owne hand, shewing howe dangerous a course the
$I Duke was entred in, thougth yow excused him sellf
$I to thinke noe harm therin, and yet thay that with your
$I safety preserved yow from it, yow must seem to give
$I them reproche of gilty folke. I hope you more esteme
$I your honor than to give yt such a staine, since you
$I have protested so often to have taken these Lordes for
$I your most affectionate subjects, and to have done all
$I for your best.    To conclude, I besech you passe no
$I further in this cause till you receve an expres mes_singer,
$I a trusty servant of mine, by whome you shall
$I see plainley yow may receive honor and contentment
$I with more suretie to your rest and state, than all thes
$I dissembling counselors will or can bringe yowe.   As
$I knoweth the Lord to whose most safe keping I doe
$I committ yow, with my many commendations to your
$I person.
$I 7 August 1583.
