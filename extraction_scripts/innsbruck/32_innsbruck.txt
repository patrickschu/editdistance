$I To the right excellent, myghty and gracious good
$I   lord The Duke of Somerseth.

$I   Right excellent and myghty Lord. After due and
$I humble recomendacion please it your noble lordship to
$I have a knowlache that amongs al other thyngis that
$I haue be shewed and opened vnto me sithence my
$I comyng in to my cur her to be reformed and corrected,
$I oon the grettest and most greuous of open disobey_saunce
$I and rebellion agenst God and the jurisdiction
$I of the Cherche hath be made vnto me wyth grett cry
$I and sorowful compleynt agenst certyn tenants of yours
$I at Shirborne and other inhabityng your towne of Lang_port,
$I whiche as men lawless, neither dredyng God nor
$I liuyng after the lawes of holy Cherche, whythout any
$I prest or clerc presume to do sacraments of the cherche,
$I as in berying the dede, and wol not suffre their curate
$I whiche vnder God and mee hath cur of their sowles, to
$I do diuine seruice nor to ministre vnto theym any of
$I the sacraments of the Cherche, nor noon of my ministres
$I or officers to do eny correction of their trespasses in
$I saluacion of their sowles. They beten also and vexen
$I the pour people dwellyng ther about, as wel my ser_uants
$I as other, that in places wher they ben ther dar
$I noon of theym come for fere of losyng of their lyues.
$I Many other offenses and dampnable dedes they vsen

<p. 341

$I and doon that greuous and sorowful is to here. My
$I Lord, it is seid that all thys they doon vnder bold_nesse
$I of you and your myghti lordship, howbeit that
$I I verrely trow and suppose that, and ye had vnder_standyng
$I and knowlache of this their misgouernaunce
$I and synful and obstinate lyuyng, ye wold -- as a trewe
$I knyght to God and holy Cherche, as wel for your
$I owne duete and trewe acquytail, that as Godys knyght
$I ye owe to hym and to hys cherche, as for the merite
$I of your sowle in chastysyng of suche synful lyuyng and
$I rebellion agenst the cherche, to whos defense the swerde
$I is delyuered vnto yow - wilne exhorte and stur al tho
$I to whom sholde longe the preuencion and redresse in
$I that behalue, to do and execute thes same truly, dili_gently
$I and godly, as their duete is, their office and
$I their power; yeving in it, if nede wer, your myghty
$I assistence and eyde, as Godys lawe and holy cherches
$I also requireth and commandeth. Truly, my lord, eny
$I trewe Crystyn prince may wel vnderstande that wher
$I as trywe obeisaunce is suffred to be wyth drawen from
$I God and hys cherche, it must sone after, by Goddys
$I ryghtful dome and punysshement, be withdrawen from
$I man that suffreth and helpeth it to be doon. Wher_for
$I after thys greuous compleynt, as is before seid, maed
$I vnto me, I, your preest and bedman, before that I wolde
$I in any wise procede to any correction, as I am beidde
$I vnder pyn of dampnacion to do, have be delibered in
$I myself to lete your noble lordship haue wetyng therof,
$I to the intent that it may not by reason be demed or
$I supposed that any wil shold passe vertu or hedynesse
$I offende the vertu of humilite or patience, and also to
$I thentente that I may haue hereinne sum maner vnder_standyng
$I and felyng of your blessed disposicion, wherof
$I I lowly beseche yow, and as fer as I may in Goddys
$I behalfe require yow, in sum wyse to be consorted and
$I acerteyned by the berer of thys my symple sorowe. My
$I right excellent and myghti lord, I beseche Almyghti

<p. 342

$I God to have yow euer in hys kepyng, and send yow
$I good lyue and long. Wreten at Woky, the xviij=the=
$I day of April.
