$I For my Noble Friends the Committee for the Isle of Ely:
$I                  Present these.
$I Gentlemen,            Lincoln, 1st September 1644.
$I    I understand that you have lately released some
$I persons committed by Major Ireton and Captain
$I Husband, and one committed by Captain Castle, 
$I all 'committed' upon clear and necessary grounds as
$I they are represented unto me; 'grounds' rendering them
$I as very enemies as any we have, and as much requi_ring
$I to have them continued secured.
$I    I have given order to Captain Husband to see them
$I recommitted to the hands of my Marshal, Richard
$I White. And I much desire you, for the future, not
$I to entrench upon me so much as to release them,  or
$I any committed in the like case by myself, or my De_puty
$I and Commanders in the Garrison, - until myself
$I or some Superior Authority be  satisfied in the cause
$I and do give order in allowance of their enlargement.
$I For I profess I will be no Goveror, nor engage any
$I other under me to undertake such a charge, upon such
$I weak terms! 
$I    I am so sensible of the need we have to improve
$I the present opportunity of our being masters of the
$I field and having no Enemy near the Isle, and to spare
$I whatever charge we can towards the making of those
$I Fortifications, which may render it more defensible
$I hereafter if we shall have more need, - I shall desire
$I you, for that end, to ease the Isle and Treasury from
$I the superfluous charge of  'having' Two several Com_mittees

<p. 192

$I for the several parts of the Isle; and that one
$I Committee, settled at March, may serve for the whole
$I Isle.
$I    Wherefore I wish that one of your number may,
$I in your courses, intend and appear at that Com_mittee,
$I to manage and uphold it the better for all parts
$I of the Isle.
$I          Resting upon your care herein, I remain
$I                  Your friend to serve you,
$I                    OLIVER CROMWELL.
