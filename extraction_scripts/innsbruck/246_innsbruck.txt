$I    Excellentest of Ladies.
$I       And most honor'd of the Graces, Muses, and mee; if it be
$I not a sinne to prophane yo=r= free hand with prison polluted
$I Paper, I wolde intreate some little of your Ayde, to the defence
$I of my Innocence, w=ch= is as cleare as this leafe was (before I staind
$I it) of any thinge halfe-worthye this violent infliction; I am
$I commytted and w=th= mee, a worthy Friend, one M=r=. Chapman,
$I a man, I can not say how knowne to yo=r= Ladishipp, but I am sure
$I knowne to mee to honor you; And our offence a Play, so mistaken,
$I so misconstrued, so misapplied, as I do wonder whether their
$I Ignorance, or Impudence be most, who are our aduersaries. It is
$I now not disputable, for we stand on vneuen bases, and our cause

<p. 198

$I so vnequally carried as we are without examyninge, without hearinge,
$I or without any proofe, but malicious Rumor, hurried to bondage
$I and fetters; the cause we vnderstand to be the Kinges indignation,
$I for which we are hartelye sorie, and the more, by how much the
$I less we haue deseru'd it. What our sute is, the worthy employde
$I soliciter, and equall Adorer of youre vertues, can best enforme you.
$I                                  Ben: Jhonson.
