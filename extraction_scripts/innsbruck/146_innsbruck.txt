$I                                                        Woking
$I                                         1 September [1523]
$I   Hit may lyke your good Grace to be aduertised that
$I I haue received your Gracis lettres directed to my selfe dated the
$I last day of Auguste with the lettres of my Lord Admirall to your
$I Grace sent in post and copies of lettres sent bytwene the Quene of
$I Scottis and his Lordishipp concernyng the maters and affeires of
$I Scotland with the prudent answeris of your Grace as well to my
$I said Lord in your awne name as in the name of the Kingis High_nes
$I to the said Quene of Scottis. All which lettres and copies I
$I haue distinctely redde vn to his Grace. Who hath in the reding
$I therof substancially considered as well the Quene his sisters lettre
$I with the lettres agaynward devised and sent by my Lord Admirall
$I to her and his lettres of aduertisement to your Grace as your moost

<p. 280

$I politique devises and answeres vn to all the same among which
$I the lettre which your Grace devised in the name of his Highnes
$I to the Quene his sister his Grace so well lyked that I never saw
$I hym lyke thing bettre, and as helpe me God in my pore fantasie
$I not causeles, ffor hit is for the quantite one of the best made lettres
$I for wordis, mater, sentence and cowching that ever I redde in
$I my life.
$I   His Highnes in your Gracis lettre directed to my Lord Admirall
$I marked and well lyked that your Grace twoched my said Lord and
$I my Lord Dacres in that that theire opinions had bene to the lett
$I of the great roode, which if hit had bene ere this tyme made in to
$I Scotland, as by your prudent advice hit had, if theyre opinions
$I with other had not bene4s to the contrarie, hit shold as by the
$I Quenys lettre appereth haue bene thoccasion of some great and good
$I effecte.
$I   His Highnes also well allowed that your Grace noteth not onely
$I remisse dealing but also some suspitione, in that the Lord Dacres so
$I litle estemede the mynde and opinion of the Kingis sister wherof
$I he had by his seruant so perfait knowledge.
$I   Finally his Highnes is of the mynde of your Grace and singularly
$I commendeth your policie in that your Grace determineth for a
$I finall way that my Lord Admirall shall sett forth his entreprises
$I without eny lenger tracte of tyme not ceacing to preace theym with
$I all the annoyaunce possible till they fall ernestely and effectually
$I to some bettre trayne and conformite. And veryly his Highnes
$I thinketh as your Grace writeth that for eny lakke of those thingis,
$I which as he wryteth are not yit cummen to hym, he shold not haue
$I neded to forbere to haue done theym with smaller roodis at the
$I leste way some annoyauns in the meane season.
$I   I redde also to his Highnes the lettre of Mr. Doctor Knyght
$I written vn to your Grace, with your Gracis lettre written to my
$I selfe, by the tenor wherof his Grace well perceiveth your moost
$I prudent answere devised and made, as well to his said Embassiator
$I as to th'Embassiator of th'Emperor, concernyng the disbursyng
$I of such money as his Highnes shold lay owte for thentretenement
$I of the XMC lance knight[s], wherin [hi]s Grace highly well ap_proveth

<p. 281

$I as well your moost politique foresigh[t] so wisely dowting
$I leste this delay of the declaration myght happen to be a device,
$I wherby th'Emperor myght spare his awne charge and entreteigne
$I th'Almaignes with thonly coste of the Kingis Grace, as also your
$I moost prudent ordre taken therin by which his Highnes shalbe
$I bounden to no charge excepte the duke ffirste passe the articles
$I sent by Sir John Russell and that the XM Almayns be levied and
$I ioyned with the Duke and he declared enemy to the French King.
$I   I red, also, to his Highnes the copie of your Gracis lettre devised
$I to Mr Doctor Sampson and Mr Jernyngham; wherin his Highnes
$I well perceived and marked what labor and payn[e] your Grace
$I had taken as well in substantiall aduertising his said Embassiators
$I at length of all occurrauntis here, with the goodly rehersall of the
$I valiaunt acquitall of his army on the see not onely there done but
$I also descending on the land with all his preparations and armyes
$I sett forth and ffurnyshed as well toward France as Scotland as also
$I in your good and substantiall instructions geven vn to theym
$I for the semblable avauncing of th'Emperors army and actuall invasion
$I to be made on that side for his part.
$I   His Highnes hath also seen and signed the lettres by your
$I Grace devised in his name as well to Don Ferdinando and to the
$I Duke of Mechelberge in answere of their late lettres sent vn to his
$I Grace as also to the Duke of Ferare in commendation of the
$I Kingis orators in case the Duke accepte the Ordre.
$I   In the reding and advising of all which thingis his Highnes
$I saied that he perceived well, what labor, studie, payn[e] and
$I travaile your Grace had taken in the device and pennyng of so
$I many, so great thyngis, so high, well dispached in so briefe tyme,
$I whan the onely redyng therof held hym aboue twoo howris; his
$I Highnes, therfore, commaunded me to write vn to your Grace
$I that for your labor, travaile, study, payne and diligens, he geveth
$I your Grace his moost harty and not more harty than highly well 
$I deserved thankis. And thus our Lord long preserve your good

<p. 282

$I Grace in honor and helth. At Okyng the first day of Septembre.
$I     Your humble Orator and moost bounden beedman
$I                                             [Thomas More.]
