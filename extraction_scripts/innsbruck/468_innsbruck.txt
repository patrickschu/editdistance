$I The only reason that kept mee from writing to you
$I Deare Madam was the fear I had of troubling you, but
$I I cannot forbeare any longer from telling you how sure
$I a sense I have of your misfortune I shall allways be most
$I heartily sory for any thing that afflicts you but in this
$I I thinke myselfe particularly concerned for both my Lord
$I and I have lost a friend wee had a very reall esteem and
$I kindnesse for and shall ever have soe for his memory
$I I will say noe more on soe sad a subject but end this
$I with begging you to believe that noe body liveing is mor
$I sincerely your faithfull Humble servant,
$I E. SOMERSET.
$I Feb. 4th. My Lord presents his humble service to
$I your La=p= and bids mee tell you he shall thinke it a good
$I fortune if he be capable in any kind to serve you.
