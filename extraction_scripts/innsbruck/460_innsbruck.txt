$I Sir,
$I    You have here at length the [four]th and last book of my
$I scattered thoughts concerning the Understanding, and I see now
$I more than ever that I have reason to call them scattered, since
$I never having looked them over all together till since this last
$I part was done, I find the ill effects of wrting in patches and at
$I distant times as this whole essay has been. For there are so
$I many repetitions in it, and so many things still misplaced, that
$I though I venture it confused as it is to your friendship, yet I
$I cannot think these papers in a condition to be showed anyone
$I else, till by another review I have reduced them into yet better
$I order. Though bateing that, and the negligence of the style, you
$I will find very little in the argument itself, that I think for the
$I matter of it needs altering. Of what use it may be to any other
$I I cannot tell, but if I flatter not myself, I has been of great help to
$I our first enquiry, and the search of knowledge ever since has been
$I in my thoughts, which is now five or six years. For so long ago
$I is it since some friends upon an accidental discourse [started me]
$I upon this enquiry, which I am not sorry for. And if it has cost
$I me some pains in thinking, it has rewarded me by the light I
$I imagine I have received from it, as well as by the pleasure of
$I discovering certain truths, which to me at least were new.
$I for being resolved to examine humane understanding, and the
$I ways of our knowledge, not by others' opinions, but by what
$I I could from my own observations collect myself, I have purposely

<p. 178

$I avoided the reading of all books that treated any way of
$I the subject, that so I might have nothing to bias me any way,
$I but might leave my thought free to entertain only what the
$I matter itself suggested to my meditations. So that, if they at
$I any time jump with others, twas not that I followed them; and
$I if they differ 'twas not out of contradiction, or a mind to be
$I singular. My aim has been only truth so far as my shortsighted_ness
$I could reach it, and where I have misstated it in part or in
$I the whole I shall be glad to be set right. Read it, therefore, as
$I a friend's act, judge of it as a stranger's, and let me have your
$I opinion with the greatest freedom, than which there can be
$I nothing more obliging to
$I                             Your most humble servant,
$I                              J.L.
$I 31st Dec. 1686.
