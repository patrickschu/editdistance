$I Pleas it youre good lordship to understande, that
$I sithens the begynnyng of the Parliamente there hathe
$I bene the grettiste and soreste hold in the lower Hous for
$I payemente of ij=s=. of the li. that ever was sene I thinke
$I in any parliamente. This matier hathe bene debated
$I and beatten xv. or xvj dayes to giddir: the hieste ne_cessitie
$I alleged on the Kings behalf to us that ever was
$I herd of: and of the contrarie, the hieste povertie con_fessed,
$I as well by knights, squiers, and gentilmen of
$I every quarter, as by the commoners, citezeins,and bur_gessis.
$I There hathe bene suche hold that the Hous
$I was like to have bene dissevered; that is to sey the
$I Knights being of the Kings Counsaill, the Kings ser_vaunts,
$I and gentilmen, of the oon partie, whiche in soo
$I long tyme were spoken with and made to sey ye; it

<p. 221

$I may fortune, contrarie to their hert, will, and con_science.
$I Thus hanging this matier, yestirdaye the
$I more parte being the Kings servaunts, gentilmen, were
$I there assembled; and so they being the more parte,
$I willid and gave to the King ij=s=. of the li. of goods or
$I lands, the beste to be takene for the King, all lands to
$I paye ij=s=. of the li from the loweste to the hieste; the
$I goods to paye ij=s=. of the li. from xx=li= upwards; and
$I from xl=s=. of goods to xx=li=. to pay xvj=d=. of the li. and
$I undre xl=s=. every persone to paye viij=d=. this to be payed
$I in ij. yeres.    I have herd no man yn my lif that can
$I remembre that ever ther was geven to any oon of the
$I Kings auncestours half somoche at oon graunte; ner I
$I thinke there was never suche a presidente sene before
$I this tyme,    I beseke almightie God it maye bee well
$I and peasibly levied, and surely payed unto the Kings
$I Grace with oute grudge, and specially with oute los_ying
$I the good wills and true herts of his subjects,
$I whiche I rekene a ferre grettir treasure for a King then
$I gold or silver.   And the gentilmen whiche muste take
$I payne to levie this money amongs the Kings subjects I
$I think shalhave no litle besynes aboute the same.
$I My lorde Cardinall hathe promysed on his feithe
$I that the ij=s=. of the li of lone money shalbe payed with
$I a good will and with thanke. But no daye is appoyntid
$I thereof.
$I I thinke nowe that this matier is soo ferre passid
$I that the parliament woll sone bee endid.
$I Asto the Convocation amongs the prests, the furste

<p. 222

$I daye of their apparence assone as masse of the holie
$I gooste at Paulis was done, my lorde Cardinall assited
$I all theim t’appere before hym in his Convocation at
$I Westm=r=: whiche soo did: and there was a nother
$I masse of the holie gooste: and within vj. or vij dayes,
$I the prests proved that all that my lorde Cardinalls Con_vocation
$I shuld doo, it shuld bee voyde, because that
$I their somons was t’appere before my Lorde of Caun_tirbury;
$I whiche thing soo espied, my lorde Cardinall
$I hath addressed oute of newe Citacions in to every cun_trey
$I commaunding the prests t’appere before hym viij.
$I dayes after th’Assencon; and then I thinke they shal_have
$I the iij=de=. masse of the Holie Gooste. I praye god
$I the holie gooste bee amongs theim and us bothe. I
$I doo tremble to remembre the ende of all thies hye and
$I newe entreprises: for oftene tymes it hathe bene sene
$I that to a newe entreprise there folowethe a newe ma_ner
$I and strange sequele. God of his mercie sende his
$I grace of suche facion that it maye bee all for the beste.
$I T’assertayne you of the King of Denmark's being
$I yn Flaundres with xvj. shippis with his wif and chil_drene
$I mesemethe I shuld not write it unto you, be_cause
$I I thinke ye bee advertised thereof by poste.
$I Howe this ij=s=. of the li shalbe levied, of what maner
$I or at what dayes it shalbe payed, yn good feithe I
$I knowe not as yet.
$I Oute of Spayne we have newes that there is a truce
$I or abstynence of Were taken bitwe themperor and

<p. 223

$I theim of Fraunce. And I thinke nowe that this money
$I is grauntid, soo shall it bee with us.
$I Under youre good favor mesemethe, and if ye thinke
$I it beste, it were a gracious dede for you, to bee meane
$I unto the Kings Highnes that x or xij M. =li= of this
$I money mought bee bestowed on the bielding up againe
$I of the Piles and Castells on oure englishe borders;
$I specially nowe that they of Scotland bee prostrate by
$I your good and hye pollicie.
$I As other newes or affayres shall chaunce soo shall
$I I bee glad w=t= diligence t’advertise you of from  tyme to
$I tyme.
$I My Lord Priveseall, my Lord Vaux, and Sir Tho_mas
$I Lovell bee all iij. right sike at this presente daye,
$I and as it is seyd Lorde Vaux in great daunger. Writ_ten
$I at London on Assencon daye by hym that during
$I his lif shalbe glad to bee at your commaundements
$I with his service
