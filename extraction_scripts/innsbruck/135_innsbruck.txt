$I Mary Queen-Dowager of France to Archbishop
$I               Wolsey.   A.D. 1515.
$I Most reverend father in God,
$I   I recommend me unto you heartily, and I thank
$I you for the great kindness that I have evermore
$I found in you. My lord, I thank you also for your
$I loving letters which you have sent me as hither, to
$I my great comfort, and in especial for them which
$I you have sent me now of late. My lord, you
$I remember, I doubt not, that, at my last being at
$I Guildford, you desired the king my brother to give
$I unto my trusty and well-beloved almoner, doctor
$I Denton, the prebend in St Stephens, which as
$I then the dean of his chapel, and now bishop of

<p. 194

$I Lincoln, had in possession, as then the king's grace
$I shewed me in your presence that he should have it,
$I and also you promised me the same, and to solicit
$I the king my brother for the performance of his
$I promise. Nevertheless, I am credibly informed that
$I my almoner is disappointed of the said prebend,
$I and that your chaplain hath it, of the which I
$I marvel greatly; forasmuch as my said almoner hath
$I done me good service in this country, to the great
$I honour of the king my brother, and mine also,
$I and that the promise was made undesired of my
$I behalf, for you were the person that only moved the
$I king to give it unto my almmoner, and I am assured
$I that his grace would not have varied without he had
$I been persuaded to the contrary.
$I   My lord, forasmuch as I see you benevolent unto
$I me in all my matters, and ever hath been since our
$I first acquaintance, and now especially, I pray you,
$I therefore, to do so much at mine instance and
$I request to desire your chaplain to resign the said
$I prebend to the behoof and use of my said almoner;
$I and I promise you that I will not cease unto (until)
$I I have gotten some promotion of the king my
$I brother, or else of some other person, for your said
$I chaplain, which I trust shall be worth do[uble] the
$I value of Saint Stephen's; and, besides that, I shall
$I help that he may have the next prebend hereafter in
$I Saint Stephen's. I pray you, my lord, send me
$I word of your mind, and that [there be] none excuse
$I made; for I assure you, my lord, [my promise]

<p. 195

$I shall be without any excuse if God send me life; I
$I  [will not] say that word that I would not wilfully
$I per[form, as] knoweth his grace. Amen.
$I   From Paris, the 18th d[ay of February,]
$I                             By your loving friend,
$I                                    MARY QUEEN OF FRANCE.
$I To the most reverend father in God
$I the Archbishop of York.
