$I   Sir: I most heartily thank you for your letter
$I and for your advertisements. If it were not for you
$I I should live in a dead place for hearing of any_thing.
$I   Touching Sir Francis Drake, I have likewise
$I received a letter from him with the like advertise_ment.
$I There happened a mischance in one of his
$I ships at Portsmouth, that a piece broke and killed a
$I man, with some other hurt. If you would write a
$I word or two unto him to spare his powder, it would
$I do well.
$I   Sir, I send you herewith enclosed all the copies
$I of the letters from my Lord Chamberlain again,
$I which I most heartily thank you for, and I pray to
$I God the Scottish King do deceive me, but I am
$I afeared he will not. For my own part, I have made
$I of the French King, the Scottish King, and the

<p. 49

$I King of spain, a Trinity that I mean never to trust
$I to be saved by; and I would others were, in that, of
$I my opinion.
$I   Sir, there was never, since England was England,
$I such a stratagem and mask made to deceive Eng_land
$I withal as this is of the treaty of peace. I pray
$I God we have not cause to remember one thing that
$I was made of the Scots by the Englishmen; that we
$I do not curse for this a long grey beard with a white
$I head, witless, that will make all the world think us
$I heartless. You know whom I mean.
$I   I have received a letter from Sir Henry Palmer,
$I that there is at Dunkirk divers hoys and lighters,
$I that be filled with ballast and great stones, surely
$I [means] for the stopping of some haven. I will
$I have a watch on them.
$I   I pray you, Sir, send me word when you think
$I the Commissioners will be sent over, that I may
$I have all things ready for them; and I pray you let
$I me know if any go in Sir Amyas Poulet's place;
$I for if he be able to go himself, if I may know of it,
$I will have especial care of him, that he may go at
$I ease.

<p. 50

$I   Sir, if there be at any time any matter of
$I importance wherein I may do any service there with
$I you, I can be quickly there and here again.
$I   I pray you, Sir, let it be thought on, as you see
$I cause upon your advertisements, it will ask a good
$I time to furnish our fleet again with men as they
$I were. I do not look to see it ever bettered. I
$I pray God it be as well when there shall be cause.
$I And so giving you most hearty thanks for your
$I most friendly dealing with me in all causes, and
$I your friendly remembrance, I bid you most heartily
$I farewell. From aboard her Majesty's good ship the
$I White Bear, the 27th of January, 1587.
$I                         Your assured loving friend,
$I                                           C. HOWARD.
