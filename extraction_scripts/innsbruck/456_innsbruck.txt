$I To Lady Tuke.
$I April 1685.
$I How to expresse the sorrow for parting with so
$I deare a child is a difficult task.    She was welcome
$I to me from the first moment God gave her, accept_able
$I through the whole course of her life by a thou_sand
$I endearments, by the gifts of nature, by ac_quired
$I parts, by the tender love she ever shew'd her
$I father and me: a thred of piety accompanyed all
$I her actions, and  now proves out greatest consola_tion.
$I The patience, resignation, humility of her
$I carriage in so severe and fatall a disease, discover'd
$I more than an ordinar y assistance of the Divine good_nesse,
$I never expressing feare of death, or a desire
$I to live, but for her friends sake. The seaventh day
$I of her illnesse she discoursed to me in particular as
$I calmly as in health, desir'd to confesse and receive the
$I blessed Sacrament, which she perform'd with great
$I devotion, after which, tho' in her perfect senses to
$I the last, she never signified  the least concerne for
$I the world, prayed often, and resigned  her soule.—
$I What shall I say!   She was too great a blessing for
$I me, who never deserved any thing, much lesse such
$I a jewell. I am too well assur_ed of y=r= L=ps= kindnesse
$I to doubt the part: you take in  this losse;  you have
$I ever shewed y=r=selfe a friend in so many instances,
$I that I presume upon y=r= compassion; nothing but
$I this just occasion could have hindered me from well_coming

<p. 441

$I you to towne, and rejoyceing with the best
$I friend I have in the world—a friend by merit and a
$I inclination, one I must esteeme as the wife of so
$I worthy a relation and so sincere a friend as S=r= Sam:
$I (Tuke) was to me and mine. What is this world,
$I when we recall past things! what are the charms
$I that keep our minds in suspence! without the con_versation
$I of those we love, what is life worth!
$I How did I propose happinesse this sum'er in the
$I returne of y=r= L=p= and my deare child — for she was
$I absent almost all this winter!
$I She had much improved her selfe by the remarks
$I she had made  of the world and all its  vanities —
$I What shall I add!  I could ever speake of her, and
$I might I be just to her without suspition of partiality,
$I could tell you many things. The papers which are
$I found in her cabinet discover she profited by her
$I readyng—such reflections, collections out of Scrip_ture,
$I confessions,  meditations, and pious notions,
$I evidence her time was not spent in the trifling way
$I of most young women. I   acknowledge, as a
$I Christian, I ought not to murmur, and I should be
$I infinitly sorry to  incur God's fu_rther displeasure.
$I There are those yet remaining that challenge my
$I care, and for their sakes I endeavour to submitt a
$I for her kind concerne, and wishe she may live to be
$I the comfort you deserve in her, that God will con_tinue

<p. 442

$I the blessing to both, and make you happy
$I which is the prayor of her who is
$I Y=rs= most affectionately,
$I M. E.
