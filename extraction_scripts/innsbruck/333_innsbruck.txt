$I WORTHY MRS LONG,
$I SINCE I wrote my last letter to you it hath
$I pleased God to take away my deare and louing
$I father from vs, which hath beene greater greefe to
$I me then I can express. I giue you many thankes
$I for this your desir which you fauour me with all, in
$I letting me heare of my nephew's good health, which
$I I am very glad of. I am confident, if my Lady
$I Bacon would take him into her care, Sr Thomas
$I and my sister would, as they should, haue a great
$I deal of reason to thinke themselues much obliged
$I to her Lap for that courtesie, she being a frend
$I which I know they highly esteeme of. I haue
$I not yet receiued answere of any letter which I
$I haue sent to my sister, which I maruell much at;
$I and shee doth the like, as it hath apeered by some
$I letters which I haue receiued from her, she chal_lenging
$I me with want of true affection because
$I shee hath not heard from me; and, God knows, I
$I haue not neglected any meanes whereby I might
$I send to her. My mother desires to haue her kind

<p. 199

$I respects presented to your worthy selfe and Mr
$I Long; so, with my owne to you both, I rest,
$I Yours assured to doe you seruice,
$I          SUSANNA BURNEBYE.
$I May the 11th, 1629.
$I To my much honored frend Mris Long, at her house in Clarkenwell
$I Close, present these, London.
