$I your having good natur annuffe after living so long in the
$I barbarous towne of London as wee contry ladeys call it,
$I to make a jurney heather I would disemble as towne ones
$I doe, and discover as I have done the facts of, but, without
$I rallerey I have heard you complain of the spleen and they
$I all esteeme the watters of this place the best cure of the
$I vappers of it, which are certinley lesse supportable than
$I the payne of anything that can be given, pray consid=r=
$I ones .advice that has lived long enough in a cold mal_ lincoly
$I aire to be perfectly learned in all the poynts of
$I that Distemper and if you have found the trouble of it as
$I much as you will seeking to oblige me, send me word that
$I you will come and be cured with-YOURS FOREVER.
