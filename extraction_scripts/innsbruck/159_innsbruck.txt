$I   Syr, the grete gentylnes of you so manyfestely schowyd toward
$I me, wythe the contynuance of such a beneuolent mynd in settyng
$I forward my purpos, gyuyth me yet a lytyl more boldnes to trowbul
$I you wyth the redyng of thys scrole, besechyng you of your patyence
$I therin, whyle I a lytyl more at large schow to you my mynd &
$I purpos, the wyche I had thought to have downe thes days past
$I presently before you, yf I myght have found you at a conuenyent
$I leysor to the heryng of the same, for gladly I wold that you schold
$I a lytyl more playnly know wyth what hart & mynd I wold serue the
$I kyng wythal. And fyrst, for as much that you may perauenture
$I juge, that I, mouyd only by the hygh authoryte wherin hyt hathe
$I plesyd the kyngys hyghnes most worthyly to set you, so much
$I desyre by your specyal preferment to be set forward to the kyngys
$I seruyce now at thys tyme, I schal besech you of your gentylnes not
$I to take me so, for, albe-hyt that by your authoryte I wyl not deny I
$I am somewhat moyd in dede, yet certaynly thys to you I wyl
$I affyrme, yf ther were not other causys joynyd therto wych more
$I scharpely styr and pryke my mynd then dothe that, I, beying to you
$I so vnknowen as I am, wold neuer haue temptyd nor enterprysyd
$I such a purpos wyth you: for yf I had not found at such tyme as I
$I fyrst salutyd you at home, a synguler humanyte & gentylnes in you
$I and yf I had not much herd of your gudnes in settyng forward at
$I honest purposys, ye and yf I had not seen & perceyuyd your
$I excellent wysedome & your other vertues, most worthy of al hygh
$I authoryte, I thynke I had neuer conceyuyd thys purpos, I thynke I
$I had neuer set my selfe in thys case, wherein my specyal trust ys more
$I to be to you bounden than in the rest of my lyfe wyth any seruyce
$I I can deserue; for of thys I assure you I am not of so vyle & base
$I of stomake as for to optayne and benefyte worldly, to desyre to be
$I bounden to any man whome I can not wyth hart and mynd reuer_ently
$I both honoure & loue. Wherfor of thys I schal besech you to be

<p. 10

$I persuadyd euer surely to haue in me such a hart and stomake as ys
$I conuenyent to be in hym, who to you of al other schal be most
$I bounden. And now, Syr, to the intent that you may somewhat per_ceyue
$I such pore qualytes as be in me, and so therapon wyth your
$I beneuolent mynd you may set forward somewhat better my purpos,
$I I schal breuely schowe vnto you the ordur, processe, & end of al my
$I studys. Fyrst, here in oxforth a grete parte of my youthe I occupyd
$I my selfe in the study of phylosophy, joynyng therto the knolege of
$I both tongys bothe latyn & greke, and so aftur passyd ouer in to
$I Italy, whereas I so delytyd in the contemplacyon of natural knolege 
$I wherin the most parte of men lettryd ther occupye themselfys  that
$I many tymys I was purposyd to have spend the rest of my lyfe holly
$I therin, tyl at the last, mouyd by chrystyan charyte, phylosopy set
$I apart, I applyd my selfe to the redyng of holy scrypture, jugyng al
$I other secrete knolege not applyd to some vse & profyt of other to be
$I but as a vanyte. wherfor in the study of holy letturys ceertayn yerys I
$I spent, aftur the wyche, by-cause my purpos then was to lyue in a
$I polytyke lyfe, I set my selfe now thes last yerys past to the knolege
$I of the cyuyle Law, that I myght therby make a more stabyl and
$I sure jugement of the polytyke ordur & custumys usyd amonge vs here
$I in our countrey. aftur thys maner in dyuerse kyndys of studys I haue
$I occupyd my selfe, euer hauying in mynd thys end & purpos at the last
$I here in thys commynalty where I am brought forth & borne to
$I employ them to some vse; and though in them I haue not most
$I profytyd, yet dylygence & wyl hathe not lakkyd therto: but what so
$I euer hyt ys that I haue by the gudenes of god attavnyd vn-to I schal
$I most gladly, aftur your jugement & aduyse, apply hyt to the seruyce
$I of our prynce, and therby rekun my selfe to attayne a grete parte
$I of my felycyte. Wherfor I besech you, syr, as you of your only
$I gudnes haue begun, so at your plesure & conuenyent leser to helpe
$I forward thus my purpos, and then schal I be to you more bounden
$I then I am yet to any mortal man lyuyng.
$I                          Your assuryd seruant
$I                           Thomas Starkey.
