$I The Queen of Bohemia to Sir Edward Nicholas.
$I Hagh Jan: 4 (1654-5).
$I Mr. Secretarie, I haue receaued yours of the 29th at my
$I returne vpon Thursday last from Teiling, and this morning
$I I haue letters from Bruxelles, who tell me that my deare
$I nephue the D. of Gloucester was there vpon new years eue

<p. 213

$I the same day I was at Teiling, but when he came thither or
$I goes from thence I know not.    I ame extreme glade the
$I King permitts (him) to see his sister and me.    I hope he
$I will suffer him to stay some time with my deare Neece, it
$I will be a great contentment to her and no hurt to him, and
$I as long as there is nothing tolde to the States of him, they
$I will take no notice of it, this I know is true.    I am sorrie for
$I poore S=r= Henry de Vic, for lett the match break or goe
$I on, it is euerie way ill for him: We heare no certaintie
$I heere how the French treatie with the rebells in England
$I goes, whither it breake or peece.    I am verie sorrie for the
$I Countess of Mortons death, I pittie S=r= Thom. Berkley,
$I but most her children.    the Queene of Sueden is now at
$I Bruxelles, where she was receaued in greate state: I be_leeue
$I the Arch-duke wisheth her at Anwerp, for she per_secutes
$I him verie close with her companie, for you know he
$I is a verie modest man.    I haue written to the King some
$I particullars of it which are verie rare ons, but the Prince
$I of CondÃ© is still verie unsatisfied with her and will not come

<p. 214

$I at her. I haue one peece of news which it may be you
$I haue not heard: the resident of Polande tells me that there
$I is a treatie betwixt Sueden and Polande and a perpetual
$I peace, and to assist one the other against the Muscovits
$I the King of Poland will quit his pretention to Sueden vpon
$I condition that he be recompenced with some lande or
$I Islande for his heire, that if they be not chosen to succeed
$I the kingdome of Polande, they may haue some place to
$I them selfs to luie in, for the K. of Polande has no partimonie
$I of his owne nor can buy anie lande under the croune of
$I Poland: his agent has order to goe for England, to see if
$I Cromwell woulde send some ships against the Muscovit
$I to make a diuersion. the good agent is verie vnwilling t
$I goe, but he must obey his master. Sure Cromwell is the
$I beast in the Revelations that all kings and nations doe wor_ship
$I I wish him the like end and speedilie, and you a
$I hapie new yeare as
$I your most affectionat frend.
$I "For Mr. Secretarie."
