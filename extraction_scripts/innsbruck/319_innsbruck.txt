$I SWEET HART,
$I I DO long much to heare how you do, wth little
$I Jane; wherfore I haue sent this messenger, by
$I whom I desier to receiue an answer. Vppon Wed_densday
$I last my Lo. Marshall was here at Bury, onely to
$I see me I thinck, for this place was out of
$I his way to Thetford, whither he went: he would
$I haue come vnto me to Mr Pead's, but I preuented
$I him by attendinge him at his inn, wher he was
$I pleased to fauor me beyond my expectation. All
$I the afternoone I waited vppon him about the ruines
$I of the Abby. I presented him wth yoe casket; wch,
$I in respect yt was yors, I could hardly fasten vppon

<p. 92

$I him, had not Mr Short wittenessed that yt was be_fore
$I sett apart for him. I exercised more yester_day
$I by walking than I haue these 4 monethes, & I
$I haue very well endured yt (God be thancked), be_ing
$I at this tyme euery way better & better. If the
$I childe be very sick, I pray do not hasten yoe com_inge
$I hither, for yoe  presence may better be spared
$I her than ther. I co(end my best loue vnto you,
$I wth my continuall prayers for you & yors, and rest,
$I Yoe most affectionate,
$I NATH. BACON.
$I [Bury, 1624].
$I To his best friend the La. Cornwalleys, at Brome, geue these.
