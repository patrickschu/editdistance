$I   Most honorable Lord:
$I      Although I cannot but know y=r= Lo: to be busied w=th= far
$I greater and higher affaires, then to have leysure to discend
$I sodainlye on an estate so lowe, and remou'd as myne; yet, since
$I the cause is in us wholie mistaken (at least misconstrued) and y=t=
$I eurie noble and iust man, is bound to defend the Innocent,
$I I doubt not but to find yo=r= Lordshipp full of y=t= woonted vertue,
$I & fauoure; wherwith you have euer abounded toward the
$I truth. And though the Imprisonment itselfe can not but grieue
$I mee (in respect of his Maiesties high displeasure, from whence it
$I proceedes) yet the Manner of it afflicts me more, being commytted
$I hether, vnexamyned, nay vnheard (a Rite, not commonlie denyed
$I to the greatest Offenders) and I made a guiltie man, longe before
$I I am one, or euer thought to bee: God, I call to testimonye what
$I my thoughts are, and euer heue bene of his Maiestie; & so may

<p. 194

$I I thryue when he comes to be my Iudge and my Kinges, as they
$I are most sincere:
$I   And I appeale to posteritie that will hearafter read and Iudge
$I my writings (though now neglected) whether it be possible,
$I I should speake of his Maiestie as I have done, without the
$I affection of a most zealous and good subiect. It hath euer bene
$I my destenye to be misreported, and codemn'd on the first tale;
$I but I hope there is an Eare left for mee, and by youre honor
$I I hope it, who haue alwaies bene frend to Iustice; a vertue that
$I Crownes youre Nobilitie. So with my most humble prayer of
$I your Pardon, and all aduanced wishes for yo=r= honor, I begin to
$I know my dutie, which is to forbeare to trouble yo=r= Lo: till my
$I languishinge estate may drawe free breath from youre Comfortable
$I worde.
$I                                            Ben: Johnson.
