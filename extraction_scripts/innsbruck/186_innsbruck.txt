$I Like as a shipman in stormy wether plukes downe
$I the sailes tarijnge for bettar winde, so did I, most
$I noble Kinge, in my vnfortunate chanche a thurday
$I pluk downe the hie sailes of my ioy and comfort and
$I do trust one day that as troblesome waues have re_pulsed
$I me bakwarde, so a gentil winde wil bringe
$I me forwarde to my hauen. Two chief occasions
$I moued me muche and griued me gretly, the one for
$I that I douted your Maiesties helthe, the other bi_cause
$I for al my longe tarijnge I wente without that I

<p. 146

$I came for. Of the first I am releued in a parte, bothe
$I that I vnderstode of your helthe, and also that your
$I Maiesties loginge is far from my Lorde Marques cham_ber.
$I Of my other grief I am not eased, but the best is
$I that whatsoever other folkes wil suspect, I intende not
$I to feare your graces goodwil, wiche as I knowe that I
$I never disarued to faint, so I trust wil stil stike by me.
$I For if your Graces aduis that I shulde retourne (whos
$I wil is a commandemente) had not bine, I wold not
$I haue made the halfe of my way, the ende of my iour_ney.
$I And thus as one desirous to hire of your Maies_ties
$I helth, thogth vnfortunat to se it, I shal pray God
$I for euer to preserue you. From Hatfilde this present Saterday.
$I Your Maiesties humble sistar
$I to commandemente
$I ELIZABETH.
$I To the Kinges most excellent Maiestie.
