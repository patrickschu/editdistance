$I    Mr Hinchlow, y=r= tried curtesy hath so far ingaged me y=t=
$I howsoever this term hath much hindred my busines, y=u= shall
$I see one Tuesday night I have not bin Idle. I thank god moste
$I of my trubles ar ended, upon cleering whearof I have taken
$I home my wife agayne; soe y=t= I will now, after munday, intend
$I y=r= busines carefully, y=t= the company shall aknowledg themselfs
$I bound to you I doubt not. One  Tuesday night, if y=u= will ap_poynt,

<p. 61

$I I will meet y=u= and M=r= Allin, and read some, for I am
$I unwilling to read to y=e= generall company till all be finisht;
$I which upon my credit shall be to play it this next term, with
$I y=e= first. S=r=, my occations of expenc have bin soe great and soe
$I many, I am ashamed to think how much I am forct to press y=u=,
$I whearin I pray let me finde y=r= favorablest construction, and ad
$I one xxs. more to y=e= mony I have receaved, which makes xil.,
$I and  y=u= shall one Tuesday see I will deserve, to my best ability,
$I y=r= love, which I valew more in it self then y=e= best companies in
$I y=e= town. So myself and labors resting at y=r= service, I commit
$I y=u= to god.
$I                                    y=rs= to command, 
$I                                       ROBT. DABORNE.
$I 16 May, 1613.
$I    Receved by me, Garret Leniage, xxs.
