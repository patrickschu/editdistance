$I yowr grett chere that ye made me and of the coste that ye dede
$I on me. Ye dede more cost thanne myn wylle was that ye choulde
$I do, but that it plesyd yow to do so; God gyf me grase to do that
$I may plese yow.
$I    Ples yt yow to wett that on Fryday after myn departyng
$I fromme yow I was at Sudbury, and spake wyth the schreve, and
$I Richard calle toke hym the ii writtys. And he brake them, and
$I Richard hathe the copes of them; and he seyd he wollde sende
$I the writtys to hys undreschryf, and a letter therwyth chargyng hym
$I that he schowlde do therine as largely as he owt to do. And I and
$I Richard informyd hym of the demenyng of hys undrchryf, how
$I parciall he hade be wyth the other partye bothe in that mater
$I and also for the acciounys beyng in the schere; and he was nothyng
$I wel plesyd of the demenyng of hys undreschref, and he hat
$I wretyn to hym that he choulde be indeferent for bothe partyes
$I acordyng to the lawe, bothe for that materys and for alle othere.
$I What the undreschryf wylle do therin I wot nere, for he is not
$I yet spokyn wyth.
$I    Item, as for Cotton, I entryd into the plase as on Sunday last
$I was, and ther I abode tyll un Wednysday last pasyd. I have left
$I ther John Paston the youngere, Wykys, and other xii men, for to
$I receyve the profyttys of the manere; and ayenst the day of kep_yng
$I of the corte I hope ther chall be more to streynkyth them yf
$I it nede. John Paston hath be wyth myn lorde of Norffolk seyth
$I we entryd, and dyssyryd hys good lorchypp to streynth hym
$I wyth hys howsolde men and other yf nede be, and he hath pro_mysyd
$I he woulde do so. And I sent Richard Calle on Tusday
$I to Knevett, dysyryng hym that he woulde sende to hys baley
$I and tenantys at Mendlesham that thei choulde be redy to coume
$I to John Paston whan he sent for them; and he sent a man of hys

$I And he sent me wourde be Richard, and hys soune also, yf wee
$I were nott stronge inough that owther he or hys soune, or bothe
$I yf nede were, woulde come wyth suche feleschipp as they coude
$I gett abowt them, and that thei woulde do as feythfully as they
$I knowde for yow, bothe in that mater and in alle other....
$I     Item, I recyvyd a letter frome yow yesterday, wherof I thanke
$I yow hertely, and I praye yow that I maye be as ye writt... Item,
$I I have do spoke for yowr worstede, but ye may not have it tylle
$I Halowmesse; and thane I am promysyd ye challe have as fyne as
$I maye be made. Richard Calle challe bring it up wyth hym.
$I     Wretyn the Fryday next byfore Michelmas Day.
