$I Right Worppll,
$I    I cannot but returne you Infinite thankes for your
$I excessive paynes in doubling of yr last letter to mee, both
$I pages whereof were so exceeding satisfactory to my re_quests,
$I as that I know not wheather of them may more
$I justly challenge a larger returne of thankes from mee.
$I for the fore-page I have traced yr commands, & simpled
$I in the woods, meadows and Fields instead of Gardens,
$I wch being obvious and in every Countrey, I may easyly
$I hereafter bee made a garden Herbalist by any shee-empirick.
$I I have both Gerard, with Johnson's addition,
$I and Parkinson; the former has the cleerer cutt, and outvies
$I the other in an accurate description of a Plant; the latter
$I is the better methodist, & has bedded his Plants in a
$I better ranke & order. I compared also Dodonæus with
$I them, who does very well for a short & curt Herbarist:
$I yet I shall embrace Gerard above all because you pleased
$I to honour him with your approbation. For the back_side
$I of yr letter, I am extreamely satisfied in yr resolves
$I of my Qu‘re. I confesse I run into too deepe a beliefe
$I & too strong a conceipt of chymistry (yet not beyond
$I wt some of those Artists affirme) of the reproduction of
$I the same plant by ordinary way of vegetation, for (say
$I they) if the salt be taken & transferred to another
$I Countrey & there sowed, the plant thereof shall sprout
$I out even from common earth. But it will bee satisfaction
$I enough to the greatest of my desires, to behold the leafes
$I thereof shaddowed in glaciation, of wch experiment I
$I hope shall have the happynesse to be ocularly evinced
$I at some opportunity by you. Sr, I have a great desire to
$I shift my residence a while & to live a moneth or two in
$I Norwich by you: where I may have the happynesse of yr
$I neighbourhood. Here are such few helpes, that I feare
$I I shall make but a lingring progresse, unlesse I have yr

<p. 283

$I personall dis-course to further & prick forwards my slow
$I endeavours. But I shall determine of nothing till I see
$I you here, in wch jour[n]ey I could wish (were it not to
$I the disadvantage of yr affaires) you would prevent our
$I expectations. Sr, I have now by the frequency of living
$I & dead dissections of Doggs, run through the whole
$I body of Anatomy Insisting upon Spigelius, Bartholinus,
$I Fernelius, Columbus, Veslingius, but especially Harvey's
$I Circulation, & the two Incomparable Authors, Des_Cartes,
$I and Regius, wch indeed were the only two that
$I answerr'd my doubts & Qu‘res in that Art. I have like_wise
$I made some little proficiency in Herbary, & by going
$I out 3 or 4 miles once a weeke have brought home with
$I mee 2 or 3 Hundred Hearbs. I have likewise run through
$I Heurnius wch I very well allow of for a Peripateticall
$I Author. Hee is something curt de urina, wch I conceive
$I to bee a very necessary piece in Physick now the circula_tion
$I is dis-covered: for since the urine is channelld all
$I along with the blood, through almost all the Parenchy_mata
$I of the Body, before it come to the Kidneys to bee
$I strained & separated, it must needes carry a Tincture of
$I any disaffected or diseased Part through wch it passes.
$I For Senertus, I cannot yet procure him, but 'tis sayd
$I hee's comming out in a new letter, & then I question not
$I but I shall have him. Mr Smith presents his humble re_spects
$I to you, and shall bee extreame glad to give you a
$I deserved welcome to Cambridge, who may doe it per_chance
$I more nobly yet not more Heartyly then will
$I               Your most obliged friend & servant,
$I                            Hen. Power
$I Ch. Coll. Camb.
$I    15th 7ber

$I       1648.
$I Sr,
$I    My Father Foxcroft and Mother in their last to Cam_bridge
$I forgott not to tender their best respects to you
$I wch I have requited in the like returne of yrs to them
$I (according to yr request) this last jorney.
