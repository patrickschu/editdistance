$I The Queen of Bohemia to Mr. Secretary Nicholas.
$I Hage, Sep: 21.
$I Mr. Secretarie, I thanke you for yours of the 18 of
$I Sept: yesterday I was tolde that all the people at Bruxelles
$I were sending theire goods to Antwerp for feare of the
$I French. Some in a ship come out of England say that
$I the mock Parliament beginn to dispute their priuiledges
$I with Cromwell, but I feare they will but too well agree. I
$I ame verie glade the King used Prince Williame and his
$I ladie so well. Boswell is well enough serued, but I
$I pittie him for he is vtterlie vndone. there is heere no news
$I at all, onelie Mons=r= de Wimmenom is verie sick. The
$I States of Holland are assembled, but Brederoke, Opdam,
$I and Merode are not yett come. it is now verie faire wea_ther.
$I when the Princess of Tarents picture is ended by
$I Louyr, which will be this day, then I may chance goe a
$I shooting, which I have not done since you went. I pray
$I deliuer this inclosed to the King with my humble Service.
$I I ame euer
$I Your most affectionat frend.
$I I pray lett me know if the Queene of Sueden did write
$I to the King by my Lord of Norwich, and if she did it
$I ciuilie or not. Sure Dick Harding is growen a fish in his

<p. 201

$I baths, for he is as mute as one, tell him so from me. I
$I think the King had better stay where he is then to goe to
$I Collein, he will not be so much at his leisure there as at
$I Aix, those of Collein are odd people, so as I ame of your
$I opinion.
$I 11/21 7=bris= 1654. R. 14/24. Queene of Bohemia to me.
