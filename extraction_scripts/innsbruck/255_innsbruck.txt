$I To my lovinge Mrs. Ben. Hoskyns.
$I Ben: I could easily condemne myselfe for an unkynd hus_band
$I yf I knew one hower wherein I thought not upon y=u=.
$I My fellow Mr Pembrug steales away: both can~ot possiblie;
$I and I worse than he; such is the reward of a mans service
$I as is among carters for horses and oxen; he that draws well
$I shall never out of the plow or teeme: Good sweete hart yf
$I I knew that it touched y=r= hart w=th= such impatie~ce as it doth
$I almost teare myne to be thus asunder: had I an horse heere
$I I would leve all & com~ to thee but then must I be discredited

<p. 65

$I for ever: for there are divers bills of the parliament com~itted
$I unto me w=ch= are to be sate upon, som to morrow som on
$I munday.
$I    O deere Ben the longer I love thee the more impotently and
$I infinitely I love. Now my little Mr. Pembrug angers me
$I that he lets me know his parting but on the instant. I have
$I receaved no rent or debt. I have payed five pound that the
$I taylor tooke up at the mercers in searge &c. and ran~e away
$I w=th= it: I have bought a filthy blacke suiet & worn it out. I
$I have payed my com~ons I know y~u may want I have sent you
$I 8=l= in gold, I have a little left, I have yet lived by my labours:
$I though now out of terme publique paynes make me weary
$I without fees. Tell by brother John on this suddain I could
$I not speake with Doctor Lake. Much wranglinge I have with
$I my brother about a cloake, but shall have it & I will sett it
$I on makinge presently. I will send by the next messeng=r=
$I what D. Lake hath done. Thus in hast I could wish I might
$I carry Mr. Pembrug cloakebagge so that I might but com~
$I by the doore and see you. I have spoken to S=r= Henry
$I Williams for Morgan, but he is gone on a suddain. I have
$I spoken to Wotton but he coms not down I feare: tell Mr.
$I Wallwyn I relye on him to goe to the judge y=f= neede be.
$I let Thom Gwillim return my recognisances and examinations
$I taken before me to the Judge carefully. God blesse thee,
$I sweet, lovinge, excellent Ben, & John, franke, Bess and Ben,
$I & God be m=r=cyfull to us all & ever.
$I                         Y=r= J. H.
$I        My hu~ble duty to my Lord
$I & most harty & thanckfull remembr~ce
$I to Mr. D. Bradshaw & his wife.
