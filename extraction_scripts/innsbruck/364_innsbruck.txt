$I           To my deare sonne Mr. Edward Harley, in Magdeline Halle
$I                                in Oxford.
$I    Good Ned  I beceach the Lord to blles you with those choys
$I bllesings of his Spirit, which none but his deare ellect are partakers
$I of; that so you may taste that sweetness in Gods saruis which
$I indeed is in it: but the men of this world can not perseaue it.
$I Thinke it not strange, if I tell you, I think it longe sence I hard
$I from you; but my hope is that you are well, and my prayers are
$I that you may be so. As you say you haue founde your tutor
$I kinde and carefull of you, so I hope he will be still. If you wante
$I any thinge, let me knowe it. On Saterday last I hard from your
$I aunte Pelham: shee and all hers are well. I beleeue you haue all
$I the inteligence of the Quene mothers arriuall and entertainement,
$I thearefore I will omite it. Your father, I thanke God, is well; and
$I for meself, I haue not yet shaked off my coold. Your brother
$I Roberd by Gods mercy to him has bine yet free from his fitts,
$I and goos to scoule carefully; and I hope he is now so wise to see
$I his stubborneness was not the way to gaine any thinge but re_proufe.
$I I purpos, if pleas God, to send the next weeke to see you.
$I Your father prays God to blles you. Remember me to your tutor,
$I and I beceach the Lord to keepe you from all euil. I haue sent
$I you some juce of licorich, which you may keepe to make use of,
$I if you should haue a coold. So I rest,
$I    Your most affectinat mother,         BRILLIANA HARLEY.
$I Bromton, Nove. 13, 1638.
