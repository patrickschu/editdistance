$I    S=r=, I wrote to yow by my wif, hopinge upon y=r= receipt of
$I all my papers, that yow would have pleasured me with 20s., if

$I not upon the play yow have, yet upon my other out of y=r= booke,
$I which I will undertake shall make as good a play for y=r= publiqe
$I howse as ever was playd, for which I desyre but ten pounds,
$I and I will undertake upon the reading it your company shall
$I giv y=u= 20l. rather then part with it. S=r=, howsoever my want
$I inforces me for a tyme, I shall shortly be out of it, and be able
$I to forbear a play till I can make the best. Is is but 20s. I
$I desyre, till y=u= have mony or security to your content for that y=u=
$I ar out of. I have upon my wifes words keept one all this day,
$I heer assuring myself y=u= would for my much good have pleasured
$I me this one, which I beseech at y=r= hands, though y=u= never lay
$I out penny more; in which trust I rest
$I                                   ever at y=r= commaund,
$I                                        Rob. Daborne.
$I 9 December, 1613.
$I S=r=, doe not thinke I incroch upon y=u=, for God
$I    is my judg, I mean playnly and justly, and
$I    y=u= shall make y=r= own terms with me in any
$I    thinge.
$I    Receaved by mee, Robert Daborne, gentleman, of Phillip
$I Henchlowe, Esquier, the 24 of December, 1613, the some of
$I seaven pounds in parte of payment of the some of tenn pounds,
$I which I am to receave of the said Phillip Henchlowe, in full
$I satisfaction of a plaie called the Owle, when I have fynished
$I and made perfect the same, accordinge to a bond made by mee
$I to the said Phillip for the same. In wittnes whereof I have
$I hereto sett my hand the daye and yeare first above written.
