$I SHEEN, May ye 6th.
$I DEAR NEPHEW, - I give you many thanks for your
$I kinde letter and the sense you have of my affliction which
$I is truly very great. But since it is laid upon me by the
$I hands of an Almighty and gracious God that always pro_portions 
$I His punishments to the support He gives with
$I them I may hope to bear it as a Christian ought to doe,
$I and more especially one that is conscious to herself of
$I having in many ways deserved it. The strong revolutions
$I we have seen might well have taught mee what this world
$I is, yett it seems it was necessary that I should have a nearer
$I example of the uncertainty of all human blessings that soe
$I having noe tye to the world I may the better prepare
$I myself to leave it, and that this correction may suffice to
$I teach me my duty, is the prayer of-Your most affectionate
$I aunt and humble servant, D. TEMPLE.
