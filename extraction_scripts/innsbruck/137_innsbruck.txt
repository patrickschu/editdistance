$I Mary Queen-Dowager of France to her Brother,
$I        King Henry VIII.   A.D. 1515.
$I   Pleaseth it your grace, to my greatest discomfort,
$I sorrow, and disconsolation, but lately I have been
$I advertised of the great and high displeasure which
$I your highness beareth unto me and my lord of
$I Suffolk for the marriage between us. Sire, I will
$I not in any wise deny but that I have offended your
$I grace, for the which I do put myself most humbly
$I in your clemency and mercy. Nevertheless, to the
$I intent that your highness should not think that I
$I had simply, carnally, or of any sensual appetite
$I done the same, I having no re[gar]d to fall in your
$I grace's displeasure, I assure your grace that I had
$I never done [against your] ordinance and consent,
$I but by the r[eason of the grea]t despair w[herein I
$I was put] by the two fr[iars ......] which hath
$I certifi[ed me] in case I come [to] En[gland] your
$I council would never consent to the marriage between
$I the said lord and me, with [ma]ny other sayings con_cerni[ng]
$I the same promise, so that I verily [thought]
$I that the said friar[s] would never have offered to
$I have made me like ove[rture] unless they might
$I have had charge from some of your council, the

<p. 200

$I which put me in such consternation, fear, and doubt
$I of the obtaining of the thing which I desired most
$I in this world, that I rather chose to put me in your
$I mercy accomplishing the marriage than to put me in
$I the order of your council [knowing the]m to be other ways
$I  [minded]. Whereupon, sire, I put [my lord of
$I Su]ffolk in choice w[hether he woul]d accomplish
$I th[e marriag]e within f[our days, or else that he
$I should never have] enjoyed me; whereby I know
$I well that I constrained him to break such promises
$I as he made your grace, as well for fear of losing of me
$I as also that I ascertained him that by their consent
$I I would never come into England. And now that
$I your grace knoweth the both offences, of the which
$I I have been the only occasion, I most humbly and
$I as your most [sorrow]ful sister requiring you to have
$I compassion upon us both and to pardon our offences,
$I and that it will please your grace to write to me and
$I to my lord of Suffolk some [comfor]table words, for
$I it sh[ould be] greatest comfort for u[s both].
$I   By your loving and most humble sister,
$I                                     MARY.
$I To the King's grace.
