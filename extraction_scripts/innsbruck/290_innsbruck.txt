$I of my love, and desier to manifest itt, that an
$I honest hart can professe, till I have the
$I happines to see you myselfe, which I hope God will not
$I denie me before your tyme of deliverance ; though
$I I am not able to sett a sertain day when, by reason
$I of my building and som busnes I have with the
