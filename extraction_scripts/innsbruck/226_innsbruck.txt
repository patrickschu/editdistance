$I   My honourable and good Lord:  I have received
$I your Lordship's favourable letter, and am much
$I bound unto your Lordship for your Lordship's
$I favours. I would to God your Lordship's health
$I and strength were answerable to your mind; then I
$I am sure this company here with me should be happy
$I to see your Lordship here.
$I   My Lord, on Wednesday last I went to Harwich
$I to see the town and the haven, which I had not seen
$I this 27 years. My Lord, it is a place to be made
$I much of, for the haven hath not his fellow in all
$I respects  not in this realm, and specially as long as
$I we have such enemies so near us as they be in the
$I Low Countries, and not more assured than we are
$I of Scotland. My Lord, we can bring all the ships
$I that her Majesty hath, aground there in 3 springs.
$I I know not that we can do so in any place else but
$I here at Chatham. That which is a-doing above the
$I town will be to very good purpose for any sudden
$I [attack], and for my part I wish it were as strong as
$I Flushing.
$I   I received a letter from my Lord Cobham, of an
$I enterprise that is sent down to burn all such ships of
$I her Majesty's as shall ride before the Rammekens
$I or thereabouts. I received this letter as I was half
$I the way comng homewards from Harwich. I
$I presently sent away a pinnace, with John Wynter in
$I her, your Lordship's servant, and did send the
$I advertisement unto Sir William Russell, with a letter

<p. 46

$I of my own; and likewise I did write unto the
$I captains of her Majesty's ships, with certain in_structions,
$I which, if the device be attempted, I
$I believe you shall hear they shall smart for their
$I device. There is two ships and a pinnace: their
$I victuals cometh out about an eight days hence, so
$I that then they will come away. In the meantime,
$I if nothing be done already, I doubt not but they
$I shall safely come away. My good Lord, God send
$I you ever well to do: and so I bid your Lordship
$I most heartily farewell. From aboard the Bear, the
$I 23rd of January, 1587.
$I   Your Lordship's most assured always to command,
$I                                     C. Howard.
