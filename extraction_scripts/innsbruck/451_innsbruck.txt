$I June 28, [1679]
$I D.s.
$I    I heard that some shipps passed by Yarmouth with
$I souldiers in them for Scotland 6 or 7 dayes past, and the
$I coffie and common newes letters tell us something of the
$I rebellion in Scotland, butt I thinck very imperfectly.
$I A litle more time will better informe us of that buisinesse;
$I and they are like to bee more effectually dealt with and
$I brought to reason by the English forces when there shall
$I bee a sufficient number of them in Scotland, for the
$I rebells hope and others doubt whether those of their
$I nation will fight heartily agaynst them, for tis sayd there
$I are more discontented in Scotland then those yet in
$I armes, so that this may bee a coal not so soone quenched;
$I though it was begun by the lowest Scots, yet the Scots
$I are very tenacious of the protestant religion & have

<p. 137

$I entertained feares & jealosies of dessignes to introduce
$I the Roman from their observation of the affayres in
$I England, & are not like to bee quieted long without
$I a parliament, & if that should bee broake of to their
$I discontent, they would be contriving agayne & the
$I English parliaments would bee butt cold in suppressing
$I them. When the Duke of Monmouth giveth a farther
$I account wee may see farther into the buisinesse. When
$I the wether proves cold & fitt for dissections if you have
$I opportunity take notice of a beare; tis commonly sayd
$I that a beare hath no breast bone & that hee cannot well
$I runne downe a hill, his heart will so come up toward his
$I throat. Examine therefore the pectorall parts & en_deavor
$I to find out the ground of such an opinion at
$I opportunity. I once dissected a beare wch dyed in
$I Norwich and I have the lower jawe & teeth; tis a strong
$I animal, hath notable sinewes & muscles & teeth.
$I    This day one came to showe mee a booke & to sell it;
$I it was a hortus hyemalis in a booke made at Padua, butt
$I I had seen it above thirtie yeares ago & it containes not
$I many plants. You had a very good one or two if you
$I have not parted with them. Love & blessing to my
$I daughter Browne and you all.
$I                             Y.l.f.
