$I Mary Queen-Dowager of France to her Brother,
$I Henry VIII.   A.D. 1515.
$I Mine own good and most kind brother,
$I   I recommend me unto your grace, and thank
$I you for the good and kind letters that you have
$I sent me, the which has been the greatest comfort
$I might be unto me in this world, desiring your grace
$I so for to continue, for there is nothing so great
$I a store [to] me as for to see you, the which I would
$I very fain have the time for to come, as I trust it
$I shall be, or else I would be very sorry, for I think
$I every day a thousand till I may see you.
$I   Sire, whereas your grace sends me word that I will
$I not give no credence [to the]m for no suit, nor for no
$I other words that shall be given me; sire, I prosmise
$I your grace that I never made them no promise, nor
$I no other fo[r the]m, nor never will [until] that I
$I know your [grace's mind] for nobody alive; for
$I  [your grace] is all the comfort t[hat I have] in this
$I world; [and I trust] your grace w[ill not] fail, for I
$I have noth[ing in this] world that I care for but to
$I have the good and [kind] mind that your grace had
$I ever toward me, [which] I beseech your grace to
$I continue, for therein is my trust that I have in this

<p. 186

$I world. Sire, as for the letter that your grace did
$I send me by [Master] Clinton, whereas you send m[e
$I word] that I should provide myself [and make] me
$I ready for to come to your grace; sire, an it were
$I to-morrow I would be ready: and, as for my lord
$I of Suffolk, and Sir Richard [Wingfield], and Doctor
$I West, there be two or [three th]at came from the
$I k[ing m]y son for to have [brought the]m to him by
$I the w[ay as they] came hitherward, [and so hindere]d
$I them coming [hithe]rward that th * * * * * * *
$I as I trust shall c[onclude in] a day or two, and then
$I  [let me] know your mind, for an when I do, I will
$I do therafter.
$I   Sire, I beseech your grace for to be good lord to
$I Mr. John, your surgeon, for my sake, and that you
$I will not be miscontented with him for his long
$I tarrying here with me, for I bore him an [ha]nd
$I that your grace were contented that he should be
$I here with me awhile; and so I pray your grace to
$I give him leave for to tarry here awhile with me, for
$I because I am very ill-diseased with the toothache,
$I and the mother withal, that some times I wot not

<p. 187

$I what for to do; but [an I] might see your grace I
$I were healed. No more to you at this [time],
$I but I pray God [to send] your grace good [life and
$I long].
$I         By your loving [sister],
$I                                      MARY.
$I   To the king's grace my brother this be
$I                delivered.
