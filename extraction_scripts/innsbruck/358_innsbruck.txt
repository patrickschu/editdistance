$I DEERE MOTHER,
$I I HOOPE, by God's great marsy to us, our sweete
$I babs are as well as thay seem; I humbly beseech
$I Him to bless them with His sauinge grace. But,
$I Madam, it dus hartily greefe me that you are so
$I sade, becas I know it will hurte you, and then our
$I suffrings muste bee more : therfor, good Mother, for
$I God sake cheere up yor sperrets, and striue all you
$I possible can to forgeete what is not to be helpte;
$I for, Madam, I hope God will bee so gratious to us
$I as to keepe our deere Frede, and bring him to us
$I again in safty, and then, Madam, wee shall bee
$I joyfull again. I wod to God I wear ene with you,
$I for trwly I wod doo ore say any thing to cheere
$I you up, for I haue more oblygation to yor Lape
$I then euer datter in law had to a mother; and by

$I thouts for me, for, Madam, God hath so infinitly
$I blest us, that to[morrow] the thurd parte of my
$I greattest trubel will be ouer, and, I think, with_hout
$I any suspission at all; I humbly beseech God

$I stagaring. My Lady Mary and my Lorde Charles
$I are married, and thay say thers more brauery then
$I has been seene a loung time. So, praing for yor
$I helth and dessyre of yor blessing and prayars for

$I Madam,
$I Yor Lapeâ€™s true affectinate datter and
$I most humble saruante,
$I       ELIZA CORNEWALLEIS.
$I  [January 8, 1633-4.]

$I to my husband till we know whear he bee.
