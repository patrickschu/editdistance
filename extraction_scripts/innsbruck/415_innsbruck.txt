$I MY DEAR FRIEND, - I am extremely troubled to find
$I by yours of the 2oth that I am not to expect the satis_faction 
$I of your company for a long continuance till after
$I your sister is up again and though I owne I am very
$I covetious of it sooner, yett I will not be so foolishly fond
$I of it as to presse you to for so very short a time pray
$I send me word if you thinke it impossible for your sister
$I to be persuaded to dispense with your absence while she
$I lays for if she would be soe selfe denying and so very
$I obliging to me that longs of all things in the world to
$I see you I should acknolidg it the greatest generossety for
$I her imaginable and a very peculiar honour to me as for
$I what you apprehend of Mrs Scropes power with me to
$I your prejudice your justification on that poynt is very
$I unnecessary for I assure you the esteeme & kindnesse
$I I have for you is much above the civility, I have for
$I her besides I have so genneral a justice for all persons
$I as never to condemn any with out indenyabIe proufs of
$I theare guiltt but Mrs Scrow (Scrope ?) is so little a person
$I in my opinion and so sildom in my thoughts that whoever
$I gave her that information I forgive them though I doe
$I not remember I told anybody of the kind things she
$I sayed of me but I will never believe it was you, when
$I you have thoughts of coming to Bredby send me word
$I and my choch shall meet you at Northampton to which
$I place choches com twice a weake so that with all the
$I conveancey you can wish for you can come heather
$I send me word by the next posst how you like this
$I proposition, if you do not theare ar outlier towns you
$I may your choche to com to, if you have any kind_nesse 
$I for me hassen me the happynesse I beg of for
$I nobody living loves you so well as-YOURS.
