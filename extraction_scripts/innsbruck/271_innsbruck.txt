$I    M=r= Hinchlow, I perceave y=u= think I will be behind with my
$I Tragoedy; if soe, y=u= might worthely account me dishonest:

<p. 65

$I indeed, for thear good and myne own I have took extraodynary
$I payns with the end, and alterd one other scean in the third
$I act, which they have now in parts. For y=e= Arreighnment, if
$I y=u= will please to be my pay m=r=, as for the other, they shall
$I have it; if not, try my Tragoedy first, and as y=t= proves so deal
$I with me; in the mean, my necessity is such y=t= I must use
$I other means to be furnisht upon it. Before god, I can have
$I L25 for it, as some of y=e= company know; but such is my much
$I debt to y=u=, y=t= so long as my labors may pleasure them, and y=u=
$I say y=e= word, I am wholy yours to be
$I                            ever commaunded,
$I                                         ROB. DABORNE.
$I I pray, S=r=, if y=u= resolv to do this curtesy
$I    for y=e= company, let me hav 40s. more tell
$I    we seale.
$I  25 June, 1613.                        pade to M=r= Daborne xxs.
