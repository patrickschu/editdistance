$I passage, the whiche was right perilous for the thiknes of mistes;
$I but, God be lovyd, I and my felishippe abowt myd nyght gat
$I Calis in goud hele and sane gart. And ther
$I I associat me with a chapplayn of my Lord the Archbischoppis of
$I Yourke, and a marchant of London; and departid not till we
$I come to Rome, thankyd be God, avoydit all parrell, not
$I withstonding the gret werres that wer in every conteray we passid
$I thorowe. And aftir my commyng to the court I mad dew
$I scrutyny of the state of your cause; wher I found the
$I regist=r= yeven to the Juge and the cause put into the rotte, ande the
$I sentence thrize writton. at the last it was aspied we had not
$I sufficiently provyd our spâ€™ull; wherfore the juge nor the rotte
$I wolde suffre noo sentence passe without we wolde prove our
$I p'pule by thaym that wer present and se it. Wherfore we wer
$I out of all remydie but on, and that was to have had a remys_sory
$I to certain Jugges, and to have brought up ij or iij of our
$I breder that wer present when the Prior and they were put owt
$I be violence. This wolde have byn grevous costely and tedius;
$I for on way and odur ye shulde not have schapid with c pund;
$I but, thankyd be God, sodenly, accordyng to trouth and con_science
$I and right, we fonde ij men that has testifyed the same,
$I and layd the remyssory, fatigacion, and grevous costes apart.
