$I DEAR MADAM,
$I As full of just sorrow as my hart can bear, I
$I retorne you affectionat thankes for your kind send_ing.
$I What a mother I have lost I need not tell
$I you, that know what she was in herselfe, and to
$I me. Yett God, that sees no affliction to worke
$I sufficiently upon me, hath this last night added
$I another heavie one to my former woe, having
$I taken my Lord Chamberlain's sonne. Yett with

<p. 66

$I this mersy to him, that he hath given him the
$I hope of another, my Lady being, as we thinke,
$I with child againe. But alas! this is but a fear_full
$I comfort to him and his freinds, considering
$I her estate, which gives him too much cause of
$I doubt wheather she will ever bring any well into
$I the world or no, for sertainly this tooke much
$I harme by her unrulynes both in the breeding and
$I bearth. Yett God is all sufficient, and I trust will
$I blesse so good a father with the joye of leaveing
$I som of his owne to succeed him; and the rather
$I am I incouraged to be confident He will show
$I favor to him and to the prayers of his freinds
$I therin, because though he was very fond of this,
$I yett, in those tymes of fear the child's being
$I subject to som infirmities gave us, he ever kept a
$I mind ready prepared to resigne att God's pleasure
$I so unexpected a blessing. Now itt is com to the
$I trial I am confident he will show well tempered
$I effects of that religious resolution, and bear with
$I pacience what the Almighty hath donne, though
$I itt be more to him then the losse of an only sonne
$I to another father. My losse of a dear mother
$I camme not so unexpectedly as my Lord Chamber_lain's
$I did att this tyme, for to outward apearance
$I his child mended, but my mother so manifestly
$I decayed daylie as I could not flatter myselfe with
$I hope she could continue long; though I looked
$I not her ende wold have binne so sodaine, yett the

<p. 67

$I disease she was subject to threatened no lesse,
$I which I, sorting with that opinion she ever had
$I since I knew her, that her ende wold be sodaine,
$I made itt, I thanke God, not so to her, who hath
$I left many seremonis how well she was prepared
$I for itt, which is my unspeakeable comfort. Itt
$I now rests for me to follow as well as I can her
$I good example, which God graunt I may, in live_ing
$I for his servis, that I may die in his favor,
$I whom I beseech to blesse you and yours, and you
$I to comende me affectionatly to Mr Bacon, who
$I made me hope att his last seeing in June I should
$I have seen you hear before this tyme, whear you
$I have not so true a friend as you shall ever find
$I your sad servant,                        L. BEDFORD.

$I Harington House, in hast, this 1st of June [1620].
$I To my honorable dear freind the Lady Cornewallis.
