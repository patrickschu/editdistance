$I DEARE LADY,
$I You should not have had so just cause to acuse
$I me for being thus long without sending to you
$I could I have told what sertayne acount to have
$I given you of my fortune, which finding in ballance
$I att my retorne out of Rutland, I still wayted to
$I see which way itt would setle before I writte.
$I Now I thanke God I can say, that out of a very
$I great and almost hopeles danger my Lord of Bed_ford
$I hath recovered so much health and strength
$I as we are out of all fear of him, and doe conseave
$I that the violent fever he hath had hath done him
$I some good for his palsy, his speach being better
$I then itt was before he fell sick, though his lamenes
$I be nothing amended. His present state setts me
$I at liberty to follow my terme busnesses, which
$I daylie are multiplied upon me, and make me
$I heavile feel the burden of a broken estate; yett

<p. 29

$I doe I not doubt but by the assistance of Almighty
$I God I shall ear long overcum all those difficulties
$I which at the present contest with me. Though
$I yesterday Sir John Haryngton hath begunne a
$I course in the Chaunsery against my mother, but
$I indeed most conserning me, wherby he will gett
$I nothing but lost labor, nor will itt cost me more
$I then som few lawyers' fees, and a litle troble, which
$I I am borne to, and therfore imbrace it as part of
$I my portion. I extreamly desier to hear wheather
$I your ill health this sommer have had so happy an
$I issue as I hoped it wold, which lett me intreatt
$I you by this bearer I may, and wheather you have
$I any purpos to see London this winter or no, be_cause,
$I if you have not, I will then send to you againe
$I before the ende of the terme, Your cousin
$I Killegrew is gonne to see your neyghbour for a
$I while, nothing altered. My La. Uvedale is be_come
$I the fonde mother of a sonne. My La. Mar_quis
<p. 30

$I of Winchester is dead, and our noble freind
$I my Lord Mounteagle very ill of a swelling in his
$I throat. John Elviston died on Tuesday last, to the
$I great griefe of all good daunsers. My La. of Rox_brough
$I grows big, and lookes her for about the
$I latter ende of the next mont of begineing of
$I December, which I fear will draw me to more
$I attendance then of late I have putt myselfe unto.
$I My mother affectinately salutes you, and this is
$I all the nuese this dull towne affords; else by this
$I you may see I should be easily invited to lengthen
$I my letter, which now I will conclude with my
$I best wishes to Mr Bacon, little Fred., and your_selfe,
$I that have no whear a faithfuller freind then
$I L. Bedford.
$I Bedford House, this 27th of October [1614].
$I To my worhty freind the La. Cornewalllis att Broome.
