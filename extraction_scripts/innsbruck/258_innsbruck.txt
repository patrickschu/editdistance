$I To Mrs Ben: Hoskyns at Hereford.
$I Sweethart: I have agreed to sell the parsonage for 830=l=
$I and 10 angells for you I could get no more possibly for
$I parsonages are at xij yeres purchase & this price comes to
$I above 13 yeares purchase. S=r= James Freere calls for his
$I money, & Seymores wydow being married to a needy fellow
$I her husband haunts me by hymselfe & others every day for
$I 80=l= so doth one kinge likewise for 50=l= that I ow for morse
$I pt of the money for Dydley. And the taylor to whom I
$I ow 72=l= for Rawlinges and some 10=l= for myself yf he
$I forbeare req~res use. Bacon calls for 10=l= that I undertooke
$I 8 yeres since for Colipep part of the price of my chamber.
$I I must be out of debt heere or else I may give over my
$I pracktise w=ch= I hope wilbe in London better then 200=l= a yeare
$I and I would be loth it should goe to pay use & the principall
$I undischarged. this day my gaignes this term com~es to 23=l=
$I I hope the terme will make it above XXX=l=. I have receyved
$I of kattle three pound for Rent of Churchehill & Bemwell
$I lands. I have sent y~ a letter or warrant inclosed to receyve
$I it of Mr. Clarke to whose son~e James I lent it as Mr. Clarke
$I usually desires me & hee had occasion therefor. J. assures
$I me he will not fayle y~ or allow it Mr. John Clarke. I
$I receyved no other rent of Som~setshire nor the 10=l= yet of
$I Mr. Whitson though he evry day he sayth he will send it.
$I my rent to Tomchester this yeare came to 25=l= w=ch= was all
$I the rent of Dover Court my lease of Titley expires at

<p. 69

$I Michaelmas next therefore I must sue to renue it as I have
$I written. So that now I have payd the seven pound 10=s= to
$I the Kinge for Dover Court out of my poore gaignes. I
$I accoumpt I must pay in debts above 300=l= heere besides I
$I must lay out above 20=l= for John Delehay to gett the cause
$I heard the next terme w=ch= he promiseth to allow or pay me
$I by his letter written w=th= Morgan Delehays hand. If I could
$I so compasse it that I owed nothinge but to Thomas Webb &
$I John Delehay I woud thincke myselfe happy for Clement
$I expects his money & yf Doctor Bradshaw or his wyfe will
$I have any money payd heere send me word. I thincke I
$I must send down one of my men to take a fine of y=u= for it
$I must be sent up & the money receyved before I ca~ com~
$I down. the com~ission shalbe directed to my lord Byshop to
$I whom I will undertake to make y~ what estate y~ will in
$I Dydley & Bernithen. I have receyved all this terme but
$I XX=l= in gold w=ch= I send y~ by this messenger my Cosen Bevan
$I of Garway. So having many grievous conflicts evening &
$I morninge betwixt me & my debts I am in hope to conquer
$I the mayn battle of them this term & skatter the rest as I
$I can single them within a yeare or 2 and then I hope to live
$I merrylie with my 2 Bens & provide for y=r= 2 girles. I will
$I bringe down every penny that remaynes above the forsaid
$I debts discharged that must of necessity be discharged heere
$I in London. my deare lovinge kynd earnest resolute weake
$I mighty desperat tender harted brave miserable dayntie boun_tyfull
$I carefull cruell godly sweet honest Ben: god keepe y=u= and y=u=
$I & your daughters & y=r= little boy whom I pray y~ doe not
$I breed a clown. Send word whether I shall bring john
$I Boorne down w=th= me. pray god I may finish this bargain
$I for yet it is but a spech write to me where y~ will keepe
$I y=r= Christmas & what small provision I shall heere make for
$I it & as y~ will it shall be. God keepe y~ sweet deere hart.
$I                              Y=r= J. H.
