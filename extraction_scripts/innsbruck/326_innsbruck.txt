$I    My very goode Lord: The wind hanges so at Northwest that I doubt
$I neither our letters nor yours can find passage: els should we not be thus
$I longe in suspence, by reason of a rumor that hath held there eight or
$I nine dayes that our side hath receved a great blow, wherin Sir Thomas
$I Winne, Sir Walter Devreux, captain Tubbe, captain Dakers, and I
$I know not how many more should be lost. Though this be yet but a
$I verball report without any certaintie by writing, yet yt is generally be_leved,
$I for yll newes commonly proves too true. Our parlament that was
$I to begin on Tewsday is proroged till the last of this moneth, and yt is
$I doubted whether or where yt will hold then, for yf the sicknes increase
$I as yt begins, yt is thought  both that and the next terme shalbe removed
$I to Oxford or Winchester. Our whole number this weeke was 379: of
$I the plague 71: parishes infected 17. We have many proclamations
$I daylie, one among the rest that no person comming from places infected
$I presume to come neere the court,another for the repressing of the in_solence
$I of our souldiers now in their way to Plimmouth that begin to
$I follow the stepps of their predecessors that went with Mansfeld, in pil_laging
$I and spoyling whatsoever they can lay hand on. Our navie is not

<p. 619

$I yet so forward that there needs such haste. The common opinion is now
$I that they go to the West Indies, which mee thincks were too long and
$I hazardous a viage for such a fleet. The Kings funerall sermon is come
$I foorth, wherin the Lord Keper hath shewed a great deale of witt and
$I learning in comparing King James to King Salomon in all his actions
$I saving his vices. The Earle of Middlesex is retired to his house at Copt_hall
$I in Wssex, having compounded for his fine with 5000=li= redy monie, his
$I farme of the sugars, and the house at Chelsey, which they say the King
$I hath bestowed on the Duke of Buckingam as likewise that he hath geven
$I the Lord Conway a pension of 2000=li= a yeare for 21 yeares out of the
$I court of wardes. Our order of the Garter is much graced by the elec_tion
$I of the Earles of Dorset, Holland, and the Lord Andover. The earle
$I of Northampton is saide to be gon after the Duke to Paris but I shold
$I rather take yt to be the Lord Compton. Mary I cannot conceve the
$I reason why Sir Paul Banning shold post thether this day sevenight unles
$I there be a purpose to lay him to pawne. Sackvile Crow arrived here on
$I Thursday from the Duke and bringes word how noblie he and his train
$I were entertained,that all things go well, that the delay of the Quenes
$I comming was only hers and the King her brothers sicknes, and that she is
$I alredy on the way hitherward. one of his principall errands is to cary
$I the Dukes gay clothes. I heare that Secretarie Morton is to be with you
$I shortly as extraordinarie ambassador and comes directly from Paris,
$I having his entertainment of fowre pound a day allowed from three or
$I fowre dayes before he went. the Duches of Buckingam is said to be
$I with child which is no small joye. So  with the remembrance of my best
$I service to my goode lady I commend you to the protection of the Al_mighty.
$I      From London this 21=st=  of May 1625.
$I                      Your Lordships most assuredly at commaund
$I                                                   JOHN CHMABERLAIN.
$I The King goes toward Caunterburie to meet the Quene on Friday the
$I 27 of this moneth.
$I To the right honourable Sir Dudley Carleton Lord Ambassador for his
$I Majestie at the Hagh.
