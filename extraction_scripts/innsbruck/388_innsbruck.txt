$I Mr. Secretarie, I ame verie glade to finde by your letter
$I that you are safelie arriued and all your companie at Aix,
$I and that you found the King and my Neece so well in
$I health and so kinde one to the other, which has euer bene
$I so since I haue knowen them. I beleeue indeed the sepe_ration
$I will be hard, but when there is no remedie one must

<p. 194

$I be content. As for my iourney up hill I cannot tell what
$I to say to it, S=r= Charles Cottrell shall informe you how it
$I goes but slowlie on, and which is stranger that it is not my
$I fault. Dr. Morley has made a verie good description of
$I the Queene of Sweden: she gaue an assignation to the
$I French Ambassadour to meet her at Breda, whither he went,
$I and so did the Prince and Princess of Tarente and most
$I of our French gallants, who came all sneaking home againe,

<p. 195

$I for her greefe was so great for the beating of the Spanish
$I armie before Arras as she would not goe to Breda. She
$I sent another account than that to the Ambassadour as you
$I may imagin, but the Landgrave writt the truth to his neece
$I the Princess of Tarente. We haue yet heere no parti_cullars
$I of this defeat, but in generall it is a verie great one.
$I I long to heare what part my godsonne had in it, for I still
$I thinke of him, being my cheefest comfort next your ex_cellent
$I Master. I ame verie glad your daughter is so
$I well, I doe not wonder at it, she is soe well vsed, and now
$I she has her father with her she is the more content, and I
$I take it verie well that all this makes her not forget her
$I frends heere. I assure you I long to haue her heere againe.
$I I am verie sorie for poore Killegrew, she was a verie good
$I gentlewoman. You will heare by M=ris= Howards letter
$I howe great a scape my little Nephue escaped yesterday vpon
$I the bridge at the Princess of Orange's house, but God be
$I thanked there was no hurt onelie the coache broken: I
$I tooke him into my coache and brought him home. The
$I Princess of Orange went from hence vpon Saterday, and
$I you will haue our Baron shortlie with you at Aix, he will
$I tell you the second part of the Queene of Sweden, for he
$I comes from her to your Court, to morrow I beleeve I

<p. 196

$I shall goe a shooting, which I haue not done since you went.
$I I am verie glade to heere that you are established in your
$I place, which you desarve so well. this is no complement
$I but the verie truth from
$I Your most affectionat frend,
$I Hage, Aug. 31.
$I Elizabeth.
$I I am verie sorie for my Lo: Wentworths sickness.   I
$I pray lett him know so from me, and remember me to Mr.
$I Chancellour.
$I I pray remember my humble seruice to the King: the
$I news of beating the Scotch is now tolde quite contrarie
$I by a ship come from thence.
$I "For Mr. Secretarie."
$I Indorsed by Sir E. N. 31=Â°= Aug: st: No: 1654. R. 3=o=. 7=bris=.
$I Queene of Bohemia to me.
