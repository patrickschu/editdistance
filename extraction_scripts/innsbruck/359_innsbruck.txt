$I DEERE MOTHER,
$I I HADE last Satterday broute me by a London_ere
$I a bill of exchange, as they cale it, for tow
$I hunderd pounds, presently to bee paid to the barare
$I therof, becas hee had alredy hade the munie. I
$I must confes the hand is so licke my husband's,
$I that I ueryly beleue it came from him, but whear
$I hee shude thinke I shud haue the munny I cannot
$I imagen; and, to, one of thos letters I sente to yr
$I Lape last was datted the same daye that the mar_chant’s
$I note was, which was the 24 of May, and in
$I that hee spack of noe suche thinge. Now what in
$I the worlde to saye to this marchant for the pre_sente
$I I knowe not, becas they say that if bills bee
$I not presently paide heare, thay send back and pro_test
$I them thear, and then nobody will trust them
$I for any thinge. Now, if that wod bring him home,
$I it weare noe matter; but, alas ! I fear it will note:
$I therfore I tould the man, more to delay the time
$I awhile, then for any hops that I hade of the
$I munny, becas I think thear is more paide alredy
$I to him and for him then is dwe to him of his halfe
$I year's reuenue, that I myselfe was alltogether un_prouided
$I of such a sume of munny, and that hee
$I sed nothing of it in his letter to me; but I wode

<p. 271

$I sende doun to them that had the ordring of his
$I bisnes, to see if ther weare any munny to be had,
$I but named nobody. I tould him it wode be neere
$I a fortnite before I coulde heare an ansor, which
$I time hee was contente to stay before hee sent backe
$I to protest him. Now I beseech you, Madam, gife
$I me yor aduis what to say to him, for I know not
$I whear to haue the munny; for, as for that that I
$I am to haue for the halfe yeare, I haue so long
$I promised paiment of what I can possibly spare,
$I that I shud bee loth to faile them, if I wantted not
$I food for my saruants and myselfe, being my hus_band
$I has a compidens besides; for out of 150£ I
$I am shur I haue promised abufe 6 score pound,
$I shift as I can, and thay com and send daily for it,
$I but as yet we can geet none out of the Exchecer.
$I I humbly beseech God to presarue my poore
$I husband, and bring him hom in saftie to us; but,
$I Madam, thes 2 munths are mity loung. But,
$I good Mother, I beseech you, be you chearly and
$I make much of yor selfe; and with thes resaue my
$I humble thanks for our poore sweete babs, whom I
$I most humbly beseech Almighty God to bles with
$I His sauing grace. Trwly, Madam, I loung to see
$I them and you, and you and them: and I hope the
$I Queene's being with childe, which now begins to
$I bee publeckly spoken of, shall bee noe hindrans to
$I my coming to yor Lape, thoe I fear it will be to my
$I stay with you; for the Queene had gifen me leaue

<p. 272

$I to a com to yr Lape when shee had gon her progres,
$I and then I shud a had too munths ore 6 weeks to
$I af staide with you, and now I fear I shall be cut
$I shorte of that time. Here is much talking of forren
$I wars and armis joyning, yet no sartentie; but I
$I humbly beseech God kepe our Fred from amongst
$I them and all harm. My Lady Harborte, with
$I all her youth and buttie, is deed of a spotted feuer,
$I which is uery rife at London: she is much lament_ed.
$I Mr Tressurer is taken in his rite hand with a
$I ffitt of the ded palsie, as he was sitting down to
$I supper. I haue sente yor Lae a littill barrell of
$I Seffill oullifs: thay say thay are uery good for the
$I spleene, if thay bee eaten in a morning fasting, and
$I disgested by sum exsersise. Sr Thomas Stafford
$I and Mr Gorge Elliot presents ther saruis to yor
$I Lape and my faire sister, to whoom with my saruis
$I I wish all happie suckses, and bege yor blessing
$I for and too us all, and so humbly kis yor Lap's

$I hands as, Madam, Yor Lap's trv affectinate dautter
$I and humble saruant,   ELIZA CORNEWALLEIS.

$I The King has sente Mr Harry Murry to see his
$I sister the Queene of Boheme: she has had many
$I fits of ane ague. The Dutches of Richman is
$I uery well recouered againe.
$I Grinwich, the 4 of June [1634].
