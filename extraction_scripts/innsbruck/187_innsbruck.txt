$I Like as the richeman that dayly gathereth riches
$I to riches, and to one bag of mony layeth a greate sort

<p. 147

$I til it come to infinit, so methinkes your Maiestie, not
$I beinge suffised withe many benefits and gentilnes
$I shewed to me afore this time, dothe now increase them
$I in askinge and desiring wher you may bid and com_maunde,
$I requiring a thinge not worthy the desiringe
$I for it selfe, but made worthy for your Higthnes re_quest.
$I My pictur I mene, in wiche if the inward good
$I mynde towarde your grace migth as wel be declared
$I as the outwarde face and countenaunce shal be seen,
$I I wold nor haue taried the commandement but pre_uent
$I it, nor have bine the last to graunt but the first
$I to offer it. For the face, I graunt, I might wel blusche
$I to offer, but the mynde I shal neuer be ashamed to
$I present. For thogth from the grace of the pictur the
$I coulers may fade by time, may giue by wether, may
$I be spotted by chance; yet the other nor time with her
$I swift winges shal ouertake, nor the mistie cloudes
$I with ther loweringes may darken, nor chance with
$I her slipery fote may ouerthrow. Of this althogth
$I yet the profe coulde not be greate bicause the occa_sions
$I hathe bine but smal, notwithstandinge as a dog
$I hathe a daye, so may I perchaunce have time to de_clare
$I it in dides wher now I do write them but in
$I wordes. And further I shal most humbly beseche
$I your Maiestie that whan you shal loke on my pictur,
$I you wil witsafe to thinke that as you haue but the
$I outwarde shadow of the body afore you, so my in_ward

<p. 148

$I minde wischeth that the body it selfe wer oftner
$I in your presence; howbeit bicause bothe my so beinge
$I think could do your Majesties litel pleasure, thought
$I my selfe great good; and againe bicause I se as yet not
$I the time agreing therunto, I shal lerne to folow this
$I sainge of Orace, "Feras non culpes quod vitari non
$I potest." And thus I wil (troblinge your Maiestie I
$I fere) ende with my most humble thankes. Besech_inge
$I God longe to preserue you to his honour, to your
$I comfort, to the realmes profit, and to my joy. From
$I Hatfilde this 15 day of May.
$I Your Maiesties most humbly sistar
$I ELIZABETH.
