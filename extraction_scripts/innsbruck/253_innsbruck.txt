$I            "To MRS. MAGDALEN HERBERT.
$I   "Madam,  Your favours to me are everywhere; I use
$I them and have them. I enjoy them at London, and leave
$I them there, and yet find them at Mitcham. Such riddles
$I as these become things inexpressible; and such is your
$I goodness. I was almost sorry to find your servant here
$I this day, because I was loth to have any witness of my
$I not coming home last night, and indeed of my coming this
$I morning. But my not coming was excusable, because
$I earnest business detained me; and my coming this day is
$I by the example of your St. Mary Magdalen, who rose early
$I upon Sunday to seek that which she loved most; and so
$I did I. and, from her and myself, I return such thanks as
$I are due to one to whom we owe all the good opinion that
$I they whom we need most have of us. By this messenger,
$I and on this good day, I commit the enclosed holy hymns
$I and sonnets (which for the matter, not the workmanship,
$I have yet escaped the fire) to your judgment, and to your
$I protection too, if you think them worthy of it; and I have
$I appointed this enclosed sonnet to usher them to your happy
$I hand.  Your unworthiest servant, unless your accepting
$I him to be so have mended him,              JO. DONNE."
