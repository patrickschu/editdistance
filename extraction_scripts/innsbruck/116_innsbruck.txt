$I Madam, my most enterely wilbeloved Lady and
$I Moder, I recommende me unto you in the most hum_ble
$I and lauly wise that I canv beseeching you of your
$I dayly and continuall blessings. By your Confessour
$I the berrer I have reseived your good and most loving
$I wryting, and by the same have herde at good leisure
$I such credense as he would shewe unto me on your
$I behalf, und thereupon have spedde him in every be
$I halve withowte delai according to yowr noble petition

<p. 44

$I and desire, which restith in two principall poynts: the
$I one for a generall pardon for all manner causes: the
$I other is for to altre and chaunge part of a Lycense
$I which I had gyven unto you before for to be put into
$I mortmain at Westmynster; and now to be converted
$I into the University of Cambridge for your Soule helthe,
$I &c. All which thyngs according to your desire and
$I ple_sure I have with all my herte and goode wille giffen
$I and graunted unto you. And my Dame, not onely in this
$I but in all other thyngs that I may knowe should be to
$I youre honour and plesure and weale of youre salle I
$I shall be as glad to plese you as youre herte can desire
$I hit, and I knowe welle that I am as much bounden so
$I to doe as any creture lyvyng, for the grete and singular
$I moderly love and affection that hit hath plesed you at
$I all tymes to ber towards me. Wherfore myne owen
$I most lovyng moder, in my most herty manner I thank
$I you, beseeching you of your goode contynuance in the
$I same. And Madame, your said Confessour hath more
$I over shewne unto me on youre behalve that ye of
$I your goodnesse and kynde disposition have gyven and
$I graunted unto me such title and intereste as ye have
$I or ought to have in such debts and duties which is
$I oweing and dew unto you in Fraunce by ye Frenche
$I Kynge and others, wherfore Madame in my most herty
$I and humble wise I thanke You. Howbeit I ver_rayly
$I [think] hit will be ryght harde to recover hit

<p. 45

$I without hit be dryven by compulsion and force, rather than
$I by any true justice which is not yet al we thynke
$I any convenyant tyme to be put in execution.
$I Never_theless it hath plesed you to gyve us a good
$I interest & meane if they woull not conforme thayme to
$I ray_son and good justice to diffende or offende at a
$I con_venyant tyme when the caas shall so require
$I herafter. For such a chaunce may fall that thys your
$I graunte might stande in grete stead for a recovery of our
$I Right, and to make us free, wheras we be now bounde
$I &c. And verrayly Madame, and I myht recover hit
$I at this tyme or any other, Ye be sure ye shulde have
$I your plesure therin, as I and all that God has given me
$I is and shall ever [be] at youre will and commaundment,
$I as I have instructed Master Fisher more largely herin, as
$I I doubte not but he wolle declare unto you. And I
$I beseeche you to sende me youre mynde and plesure in
$I the same, which I shall be full glad to followe with
$I Goddis grace, which sende and gyve unto you the full
$I accomplyshment of all youre noble and vertuous
$I de_syrs. Written at Grenewiche the 17 day of July, with
$I the hande of youre most humble and lovynge sonne
$I H. R.

$I After the wryting of thys Letter, your Confessour
$I delyvered unto me such Letters and wrytings
$I obliga_tory of your duties in Fraunce which hit hath plesed

<p. 46

$I you to sende unto me, which I have received by an
$I In_denture of every parcell of ye same. Wherfore
$I eft_soons in my most humble wise I thank you, and I
$I pur_pose hereafter, at better leisure, to knowe youre
$I mynde and plesure further therein. Madame I have
$I encom_bred you now with thys my longe wrytings, but
$I me thyngks that I can doo no less, considering that hit is
$I so selden that I do wryte, wherfore I beseeche you to
$I pardon me, for verrayly Madame my syghte is nothing
$I so perfitt as it has ben; and I know well hit will
$I dis_plesed though I wryte not so often with myne owne
$I hand, for on my fayth I have ben three dayes or I
$I colde make an ende of this Letter.
$I To My Lady.
