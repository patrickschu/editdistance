$I DEAR CORNEWALLIS,
$I HAD I not continually for a long tyme expected
$I your coming up, it had been more needfull for me
$I then you to have excused so long a silence. Now,
$I having that to allege for myselfe, I will tell you
$I that I cannot so easily forgett the many
$I proofes I have had of your affection as for the omission of
$I any seremony to suspect itt. I should have binne
$I extream sorry to hear of your children not being
$I well, if withall I had not heard so good newse
$I of ther amendment, whos health I will hartely pray
$I may so fast increase as I may see both you and
$I them shortly hear, which I know cannot be but
$I that I shall have Mr Bacon's Company too, whos
$I good opinion and love I shall ever declare my
$I redines to observe whensoever I shall be so
$I happy as to know any ocation whearby I may
$I wittnes what I am to him for his owne worth and
$I your sake, whos
$I Most faithfull and affectionat freind I am,
$I L. BEDFORD
$I Whight hall, in hast, this Good-friday at 12 o'clock [1616].
$I My La. of Roxbrough is so near her tyme as
$I she is not able to wait, which tyes me to a very
$I strickt attendance. Her sonne is dead. My La.

<p. 36

$I of Somersett is sent to the Tower, and will be
$I very shortly arraigned. The Queen's leg is holle;
$I to prevent a relapse, as soone as the K. is gonne,
$I she retornes to Grenwich and enters into a diet
$I this spring. This is all the newse I can wright you.

$I To my worthy friend the La. Cornewallis.
