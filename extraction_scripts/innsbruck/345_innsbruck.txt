$I MADAME,
$I COMING to see my cosen Randolph, shee gave
$I me incurragment that by lines ons more to tender

<p. 233

$I my humble respects to your Lap wold not bee ill
$I taken; which if I may have the happines to know
$I from you, I shall not faile in this sarvis, or any
$I that I think your Lap will exsepte of. And for the
$I last letter I sent you, I ashure your Lap your
$I sonne had no hand in it, for it was written before
$I he came home, and sent to the carrier's after he
$I was gon, and so I gave it to my cosen Randolph to
$I send; being very sorry that it was your Lap's ple_sure
$I to give ocasion to wright to you in that style,
$I for ther was nothing more contrary to my will,
$I and I hope it shall bee the last in that kind that
$I shall pas between us: but while you are plesed to
$I stand at this distans, I feare my husband will not
$I do that which his hart most desirs, for he does
$I ashure himself that affection you ons had to him is
$I clear gon, and that it is hopeles for him to seek
$I your love. I hope by your goodnes thes doughts
$I shall bee taken away; and if the King and Queen's
$I promis to yourselfe, of doing that for us as soon as
$I they can, will bee any satisfaction to your Lap, I
$I will procure them to you, if your Lap's ocasion
$I bring you to town, wher I shall be happy with
$I your sonne to wait on you; or else I am afraid
$I you will not meet a great while, for he dares not
$I com down any more: therfore I shall wish for
$I som good ocasion that may bring you together,
$I and make a harty frendshippe amongst us. But
$I give me leave, I besech you, but not to hinder the

<p. 234

$I speediest that I can getting of what we have pro_mised
$I to your Lap, to wish that the frendshipp
$I might be before, otherwise I must confes to your
$I Lap that I shall not joy in it; and give me leave
$I to say, that you will do yourselfe as much right as
$I you will give your sonn comfort and happines.
$I But your Lap is wise, and knows what is fittest for
$I you; and I can but wish you the greatest happines,
$I which I shall ever wish, that am
$I Yor Lapâ€™s, if you ples to exsept it, affectionate
$I and obedient daughter,
$I          E. CORNWALLEIS.
$I 1630-31.
$I For my honored mother the Lady Bacon, at her house at Broome,
$I these.
