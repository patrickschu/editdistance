$I SIR,â€”If my busynes had not bene much, and
$I my stay at Redgrave very littill, I hade purposed
$I to have sene you at Palgrave. But, I humbly
$I thanke God, I did heare there you wear somthing
$I amended; I praye God to perfect your recovery.
$I I have received your letters, but I have not leysure
$I neyther to reade them as I shoulde, nor to wright

<p. 11

$I an answer as I would, my howse being full of
$I strangers; but, if God will, I will wright shortly.
$I My sonne Nath. as I thinke is at London, if he
$I be not gonne beyond the seas, which he did pur_pose,
$I as I percieved by his letters the last weak.
$I Soon his distance will be very great, so as we are
$I content to lett hym travell for his recreation.
$I You shall hear from me shortly: till then, fare
$I well! By a dim candle, and old eyes going to
$I bedd.
$I Yor assured freind,
$I ANNE BACON.
