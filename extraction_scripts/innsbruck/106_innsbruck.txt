$I To the worshipfull Sir Robart Plompton, kt. be thes delivered
$I                            in hast.
$I   Right worshipful Sir, in my most harty wise I recommend me
$I unto you, desiring to witt your prosperytie and wellfayre; letting
$I you understand that I and all your children is in good health
$I (blessed be Jesu) with all your servants. Lettyng you to under_stand
$I that my Lord Archbishop sent one servant of his unto my
$I son William, chardging him in the Kyngs name to sette in the
$I tenaunts agayne; and if he wold not, he wold send to the sche_reffe,
$I and cause him to poynt them in agayne. And so I sent one
$I servant to the schereffe, and the schereffe shewed my servant that
$I my Lord had wrytten unto him for to poynt them on agayne.
$I But my sone kepes them forth as yet, and therfor I trow my lord
$I Archbishop will compleane of my son and you; and sath that he
$I will indyte them that was at castyng out of tham. And, Sir,
$I I pray you that you be not myscontent, that I sent not to you, for
$I indeed I make the labor that is possible for me to make, and as
$I yet I cannot speed; but as shortly as I can, I shall spede the
$I matter. No more at this tyme, but the Trenytie have you in his
$I keeping. Scribled in hast, at Plompton, this sunday next after St.
$I Kateryne day.
$I                                         Be your wiffe, dame
$I     (27 Nov. 1502.)                     AGNES PLOMPTON.
