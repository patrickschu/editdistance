$I Right Worpll,
$I    I could not overslippe those kind respects, & faire
$I expressions you pleas'd to shew towards me in Mr. Smiths
$I Letter, without the returne of a few gratulatory lines.
$I The presentment whereof I cannot count a piece of pre_sumption,
$I since you Layd me the foundation to worke
$I upon, I cannott but really thanke you for the Com_munication
$I of your opinion; I shall trace your directions,
$I by wch meanes I question not but I shall attaine to the
$I utmost of my desires.
$I    My yeers in the university are shott up to a midle
$I Bachelaur-shippe which height of a Graduate I am sure
$I ought to speake him Indefective in any part of Philosophy.
$I    Our second yeere of sophistry is always taken up in
$I physicall contemplation (without perfect knowledge
$I whereof no cleere passage is granted to any in the com_mancement
$I house) & I hope no materiall piece then
$I pass'd my eie, an extract whereof is not remanent in my
$I present selfe. Yet I shall (submitting to your maturer
$I judgment) review the whole body of Philosophy, especi_ally
$I Naturall. The pleasantnesse of which science (had
$I not your desires concurred) might have reinvited me to
$I that study. I intended to have seene Cambridge a moneth
$I since: But some intervening accidents still quas'd my
$I jorney: And now you know that supernaturall cause
$I wch prolongs my stay here. I hope the heavynesse of
$I that hand will shortly be removed, & our Colledge re_pupilld,
$I & then (god willing) I will increase the number.
$I I shall waite there of your instructions. What Physicall
$I Institutions you please to appoint, I question not but the
$I University affords, & I shall be ready to make use of
$I them, & of each opportunity the weeke affords, wherin
$I I may visit you by a paper-mercury. If (after I have
$I finished the Theoreticall part of Physick) you will be

$I pleas'd to induct me into some practicall knowledge,
$I Your commands shall fetch me up any time to Norwich,
$I where I shall be very glad to weare the Livery of,
$I                 Sr,    Your obliged friend and servant,
$I                                Henry Power
$I Hallifax 13th of June
$I      1646.
$I    Our town can furnish you with very small news,
$I only the death of some of your acquaintance, vz. Mr
$I Waterhouse and Mr Sam. Mitchell. This enclos'd is from
$I my Father in Law to your selfe: if your occasions will
$I permitt the returne of a few lines to either of us by this
$I bearer, wee shall be very glad to accept them.
$I To the Right Worpll Dr Browne resident in Norwich
