$I To the worshipful Sir Robart Plompton, kt. be thes delivered
$I                           in hast.
$I    Sir, in the most hartiest wyse I recommennd me unto you, de_siring
$I to heare of your prosperitie and welfaire, and of your good
$I spede in your matters; certyfiing you that I, and my sone Wil_liam,
$I with all your children, are in good health (blessed be Jesu)
$I with all your servants. Sir, ye, and I, and my sone, was content
$I at your departing, that my sone should take the farmes at Mar_tingmas
$I of his tenaunts, or els cast them forth and prayse ther
$I goods; and so my sone hath done with some of them. And here
$I are the names of them that hath payd me; Robert Wood, Peter
$I Cott, John Gloster, Robart Taler, William Bentham. Sir it ys
$I let us to understand that thers other tenaunts, that are cast forth,

<p. 168

$I hath bene at Cothorpe, and made one ragman to compleane on
$I my sone and you, that ye take ther goods from them. And that
$I is not soe, for my sone hath sent for the neighbours of Knares_brough,
$I and Harrygate, and Spofforth, to set pryse on ther comon
$I and cattell after ther conscience; and my sone hath set to streys
$I some in ther layes, for ther is some that will not apply to his
$I mynd. And they purpose to get on discharg for my sone, that
$I they may be set in agayn, and he not to occupie; therfore I pray
$I you to take good heed therupon. And they have set there names
$I in the ragman that hath payd my sone; that they know not of,
$I nor will not be conselled therto. Also, Sir Richard Goldsbrough
$I hath taken an ox of William Bentham, that was dryven over the
$I water with ther cattell of the towne of Plompton that he caused
$I to be put over, for the sayfgard of ther cattell. And when he came
$I for his ox, he answered him and sayd; Sir John Roclife had
$I wrytten for certayne tenaunts to be so taryed by him, and spirred
$I him, whose tenaunt he was, and he shewed him whos he was.
$I And he will not let him have them without a replevie, and I trow
$I he will dye in the fold; for I sent William Skirgell and William
$I Croft, and they cannot get him without a replevie. And therfore
$I if ye can find any remedie, I pray you for; and also I pray you to
$I send me some word, as sone as ye may, of your good speed. No

<. 169

$I more at this tyme, but I betake you to the keping of the Trenetie.
$I From Plompton in hast, the xvi day Novembris.
$I                                 By your wife, Dame
$I     (16 Nov. 1502.)                    AGNES PLOMPTON.
