$I   To my Cossin Plompton of Plomptom, this be delivered.
$I   Cossen Plompton, I recomend me to you, and as I perceive by
$I my son Robart servant, ye say ye will come over and hunt with
$I me; and it please you so to do, ye shal be as hertyly welcome as
$I any man that cam heare of a good space. Ye shall se your arrow
$I fly and your grayhound run, and all thos that comes with you,
$I winter and somer, when it please you to come; as long as I live.
$I As for the other matter, I pas not a litle of it; I have yet waide
$I it with my councill; and as ye shall know at our meting, as I am
$I informed, and as I take it, thear ar many dowts by yt. When I

$I but my wife ye shal be sur to find, and she will send som with
$I you that shall let you se both rid and fallow, if ye will take the

$I Thornehill. I thinke ye weare never yet in no grownd of mine,
$I and I never say no man naye. Therfore, the faut is in you and
$I not in me; ye may amend the faut when it please you. The cause
$I of my sending of my servant at this time, is this; he informes
$I me that in your countrie thear is a man that can kill otters very

$I asure you, they do me exceding much harme at divers places, and
$I especiall at Woodkirk and Thornhill, and lyes in small becks.
$I My folks se them daly, and I can not kill them; my hownds be
$I not used to them. From Sothill, the 8 of November.
$I                         By your asured kinsman,
$I                                   Henry Savill, knt.
$I   After the making herof, or it was sealed, cam my son home from
$I London. Of Wedsday came my Lord of Norfock to the Court.
$I The Spanish Duke is gon; the earle of Hertfort, the Bishop of
$I Winchester, with the French Imbasodor, is gon to the Emporor;
$I the Duke of Sufolk with other remaines at Calisse. The French_
$I men that wear of sea ar gon to Depe haven, and the Inglish men
$I ar of the sea, but the cold weather will sufer no man long to con_tinue
$I of the water. As conserning news of Scotland, give cre_dence
$I to this bearrer. This is my owne hand.
