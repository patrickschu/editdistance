$I             "To Sir H[enry] G[oodyer].
$I    "This Tuesday Morning, which hath brought me to
$I London, presents me with all your letters. Methought it
$I was a rent day, I mean such as yours, and not as mine; and

<p. 170

$I yet such too, when I considered how much I owed you for
$I them, how good a mother, how fertile and abundant the
$I understanding is, if she have a good father; and how well
$I friendship performs that office. For that which is denied
$I in other generations is done in this of yours: for here is
$I superfetation, child upon child, and that which is more
$I strange, twins at a latter conception.
$I    "If in my second religion, friendship, I had a con_science,
$I either errantem to mistake good and bad and indif_ferent,
$I or opinantem to be ravished by other's opinions or
$I examples, or dubiam to adhere to neither part, or crupu_losam
$I to incline to one, but upon reasons light in them_selves,
$I or undiscussed in me (which are almost all the
$I diseases of conscience), I might mistake your often, long
$I and busy letters, and fear you did but entreat me to have
$I mercy upon you and spare you; for you know our Court
$I took the resolution, that it was the best way to despatch
$I the French Prince back again quickly, to receive him
$I solemnly, ceremoniously, and expensively, when he hoped
$I a domestic and durable entertainment.
$I    "I never meant to excel you in weight nor price, but in
$I number and bulk I thought I might, because he may cast
$I up a greater sum who hath but forty small monies, than he
$I with twenty Portugueses. The memory of friends (I mean
$I only for letters) neither enters ordinarily into busied men,
$I because they are ever employed within, nor into men of
$I pleasure, because they are never at home. For these wishes
$I therefore which you won out of your pleasure and recrea_tion,
$I you were as excusable to me if you write seldom, as
$I Sir H Wotton is, under the oppression of business, or the
$I necessity of seeming so; or more than he, because I hope
$I you have both pleasure and business: only to me, who have
$I neither, this omission were sin; for though writing be not
$I of the precepts of friendship, but of the counsels, yet, as in
$I some cases to some men counsels become precepts, and
$I though not immediately from God, yet very roundly and
$I quickly from His Church (as selling and dividing goods
$I in the first time, continence in the Roman Church, and
$I order in decency in ours), so to me who can do nothing

<p. 171

$I else, it seems to bind my conscience to write; and it is sin
$I to do against the conscience, though that err.
$I    "Yet no man's letters might be better wanted than
$I mine, since my whole letter is nothing else but a confession
$I that I should and would write. I owed you a letter in
$I verse before by mine own promise, and now that you think
$I that you have hedged in that debt by a greater by your
$I letter in verse, I think it now most seasonable and fashion_able
$I for me to break. At least, to write presently, were to
$I accuse myself of not having read yours so often as such a
$I letter deserves from you to me.
$I   "To make my debt greater (for such is the desire of
$I all, who cannot or mean not to pay) I pray read these two
$I problems: for such light flashes as these have been my
$I hawkings in my Surrey journeys. I accompany them with
$I another rag of verses, worthy of that name for the small_ness,
$I and age, for it hath long lain among my other papers,
$I and laughs at them that have adventured to you: for I
$I think till now you saw it not, and neither you nor it should
$I repent it. Sir, if I were anything, my love to you might
$I multiply it, and dignify it: but infinite nothings are but
$I one such; yet since even chimeras have some name and
$I titles, I am also                           Yours."
[July?_1607.]
