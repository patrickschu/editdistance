$I ELIZABETH R.      By the Queen.
$I Right trusty and right welbelovid Cosin and Coun_sellor
$I we greete yow well.   Whereas the Queene of
$I Scotts hath ben destitute of a Frenche Secretary sens
$I the deathe of Rollet, and hath by her awne lettres,
$I and by meanes out of France, desyred us to suffer
$I an other to come and supplye that place about her;
$I which we have hitherto forborne to graunt, for dy_vers
$I good causes, and emong other, for the evell of_fices
$I whiche her other Secretary did there, wherof
$I yow ar not ignorant.   Now forasmuche as the bearer
$I hereof, called de Naou,  a Frencheman, hath ben
$I chosen and recommended to us by our brother the
$I Frenche King, with request that he may gooe to her
$I and serve her as her Secretary, and hath promised
$I that he shall carye himself in that even maner that
$I becommeth an honest mynister, nor shall practise any
$I hurtfull or offensyve thing, which he himself hath
$I also vowed and promisid heere, with offer that if he
$I shall at any tyme be fownd fawtye, he submittith him
$I self to any punishment: Upon these respects, and at
$I her earnest request, we ar pleased that the said de
$I Naou shall resort thither and abyde with her as her
$I Secretary.   And so our pleasour is yow shall receave
$I him into her company, and suffer him to serve her in
$I that place; admonishing him now, at his entrey, and
$I also herafter, to have consideracion of the caution
$I whiche our said brother the Frenche King hath gyven

<p. 279

$I us for him; and also of his awne promes, as he will
$I avoyd the danger wherin he hath condempnid him_self,
$I if he shalbe herin fownd faultye. Geven vnder
$I our Signet at our Mannor of Saint James the xxix=th=
$I of Marche, 1575. in the xvij=th= yere of our Reign.
$I To our right trusty and right welbeloved
$I Cosin and Counsellor, the Erle of
$I Shreusbury, Erle-Marshall of England.
