$I To my honoured Friends the Deputy Lieutenants for the County
$I                         of Suffolk.
$I GENTLEMEN,                        Cambridge, 10th March 1642.
$I    I am sorry I should so often trouble you about the
$I business of money: it's no pleasant subject to be too
$I frequent upon. But such is Captain Nelson's occasion,
$I for want thereof, that he hath not wherewith to satis_fy
$I for the billet of his soldiers; and so this Business
$I for Norfolk, so hopeful to set all right there, may fail.
$I Truly he hath borrowed from me, else he could not
$I have paid to discharge this Town at his departure.
$I    It's a pity a Gentleman of his affections should be
$I discouraged! Wherefore I earnestly beseech you to
$I consider him and the Cause. It's honourable that you
$I do so.  What you can help to, be pleased to
$I send into Norfolk; he hath not wherewith to pay a
$I Troop one day, as he tells me. Let your return be
$I speedy,  to Norwich.
$I        Gentlemen, command
$I                 Your servant,
$I                          OLIVER CROMWELL.
$I    ‘P.S.’ I hope to serve you in my return: with your
$I conjunction, we shall quickly put an end to these
$I businesses, the Lord assisting.
