$I Gentlemen my very worthy friends,
$I    I have very litle subject of writing, the present businesse of Parlia_ment
$I hauing been all concluded yesterday morning. For his Majesty
$I sent up for the Commons to the House of Lords and Prorogued the
$I Parliament till the twenty third of this moneth. You know that
$I always upon Prorogation whatsoever businesse was imperfect and
$I depending is quite cut of and if the Parliament intend to proceede
$I againe upon it, they must resume all from the very beginning. One
$I thing you may please to take notice of that the Corne-clause is by the
$I period of this Session expired. Also this Prorogation hauing thus
$I happened & if there should be a Peace, it is now in the King and
$I Parliaments power to revoke the French Prohibition next Meeting.
$I It is probable the continuance of the Additionall Duty on French &
$I other Wines may then too be considered. I doubt not but many will
$I reflect upon this Prorogation for other reasons. But they that discourse
$I the lest and thinke the best of it will be the wisest men and the best
$I Subjects. God in mercy direct his Majesty always to that which may
$I most conduce to his own and the Kingdomes happinesse. I remaine
$I Gentlemen &c:
$I                         Your most affectionate Servant
$I                                Andr: Marvell
$I    Westm: May. 14. 1678.
