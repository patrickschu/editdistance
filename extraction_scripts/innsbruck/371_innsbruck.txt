$I To my assured friend Robert Barnard, Esquire: Present these.
$I      MR. BARNARD,          `Huntingdon,' 23d January 1642.
$I    It's most true, my Lieutenant with some other sol_diers
$I of my troop were at your House. I dealt ‘so’

<p. 126

$I freely ‘as’ to inquire after you; the reason was, I had
$I heard you reported active against the proceedings
$I of Parliament, and for those that disturb the peace of this
$I Country and the Kingdom, - with those of this Country
$I who have had meetings not a few, to intents and pur_poses
$I too-too full of suspect.
$I    It's true, Sir, I know you have been wary in your
$I carriages: be not too confident thereof. Subtlety may
$I deceive you; integrity never will. With my heart I
$I shall desire that your judgment may alter, and your
$I practice. I come only to hinder men from increasing
$I the rent, - from doing hurt; but not to hurt any man:
$I nor shall I you; I hope you will give me no cause. If
$I you do, I must be pardoned what my relation to the
$I Public calls for.
$I    If your good parts be disposed that way, know
$I me for         Your servant,
$I                     OLIVER CROMWELL.
$I    Be assured fair words from me shall neither deceive
$I you of your houses nor of your liberty.
