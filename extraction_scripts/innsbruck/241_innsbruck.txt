$I    "Sir,  Of myself (who, if honesty were precious, were
$I worth the talking of) let me say a little. The Commis_sioners
$I by imprisoning the witnesses and excommunicating
$I all us, have implicitly justified our marriage. Sir George
$I will, as I hear, keep her till I send for her: and let her re_main
$I there yet, his good nature and her sorrow will work
$I something. I have liberty to ride abroad, and feel not
$I much of an imprisonment. For my return to my Lord,
$I and Sir George's pacification, you know my means, and
$I therefore my hopes.
$I    "Of Ostend it is said there hath been a new blow given.
$I Losses of men somewhat equal, but the enemy hath re_covered
$I a trench with Sir Francis had held out of the town.
$I The States have honoured him by publishing an edict with
$I sharp punishment to any that spoke dishonourably of his
$I parley with the Archduke. If the Emperor were dead
$I before you went, perchance he is buried by this time.

$I    "I hope somebody else hath had the ill luck to tell
$I you first, that the young Bedford is dead. The King of
$I Spain intends to spend this summer in Italy: and there
$I I think by that time will be our Lords of Pembroke,
$I Willoughby, and Worcester. The Lord-Deputy hath cut
$I off some of Tyrrels now lately, but no great number. I
$I send this letter to ask the way to Polesworth: if I hear it,
$I find it, I shall cost you half-an-hour a week to read the
$I rest. I hear nothing of your warrant from Mr. Andrew
$I Lee. Take my love and honesty into the good opinion,
$I and commend my poor unworthy thanks and service to
$I your good lady. 23rd february 1601[2] from my chamber
$I at Mr. Haines' house by the Savoy (for this language your
$I subscriptions use).
$I                   "Your true certain friend,
$I                                         "Jo. Donne.
