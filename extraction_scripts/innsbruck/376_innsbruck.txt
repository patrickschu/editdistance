$I To my honoured Friend Oliver St. John, Esquire, at Lincoln's
$I                    Inn: These present.
$I      Sir,       'Eastern Association,' 11th Sept. `1643.'
$I    Of all men I should not trouble you with money
$I matters, - did not the heavy necessities my Troops
$I are in, press me beyond measure. I am neglected ex_ceedingly!
$I    I am now ready for my march towards the Enemy;
$I who hath entrenched himself over against Hull, my
$I Lord Newcastle having besieged the Town. Many of
$I my Lord of Manchester's Troops are come to me: very
$I bad and mutinous, not to be confided in;  they paid
$I to a week almost; mine noways provided-for to support
$I them, except by the poor Sequestrations of the County
$I of Huntingdon!  My Troops increase. I have a lovely
$I company; you would respect them, did you know them.
$I They are no "Anabaptists"; they are honest sober
$I Christians:  they expect to be used as men!
$I    If I took pleasure to write to the House in bitter_ness,
$I I have occasion. 'Of' the 3,000 l. allotted to me, I
$I cannot get the Norfolk part nor the Hertfordshire: it
$I was gone before I had it.  I have minded your ser_vice
$I to forgetfulness of my own and Soldiers' necessities.
$I I desire not to seek myself:  but I have little
$I money of my own to help my Soldiers. My estate is
$I little. I tell you, the business of Ireland and England

<p. 168

$I hath had of me, in money, between Eleven and Twelve
$I Hundred pounds;  therefore my Private can do little
$I to help the Public. You have had my money: I
$I hope in God I desire to venture my skin. So do
$I mine. Lay weight upon their patience; but break it
$I not! Think of that which may be a real help. I be_lieve
$I 5,000 l. is due.
$I    If you lay aside the thought of me and my Letter,
$I I expect no help.  Pray for
$I       Your true friend and servant,
$I               OLIVER CROMWELL.
$I    'P.S.' There is no care taken how to maintain
$I that Force of Horse and Foot raised and a-raising for
$I my Lord of Manchester. He hath not one able to put on
$I 'that business.' The Force will fall if some help not.
$I Weak counsels and weak actings undo all!  [two_words_crossed_out]
$I  all will be lost, if God help not!
$I Remember who tells you.
