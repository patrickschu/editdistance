$I         To my deare housband S=r= Robart Harley, Knight.
$I S=r=  I thanke you for sending me word, I may hope to see you at
$I Easter, which time will be much longed for by me. I hope the par_lament
$I has spent as much time as will satisfy them in dooing nothing:
$I so that nowe some good frute of theare meeting will be brought to
$I ripnes, which is the effect of our prayers. This day I deleverd the
$I L100 to my father: which he has payed to Mr. Davis: that mony
$I that was wanting of it, was made vp with the L50 pounde Mr.
$I Lacy payed for wood. The payling of the nwe parke is made an
$I end of. Yesterday your company only was at Heariford, to shewe
$I what they had lerned, whear Sr. John Skidemore and Mr. Vahan
$I weare judges; and so they meane to be of the reest of the companis,
$I and they haue apointed teen of your company to learne the use of
$I theiare armes and so to teache the reest. This last night I not being
$I very well, made me seend this day for the midwife, which I thinke
$I I should haue defered to longe. I assure myself I haue your prayers,
$I becaus you haue so great a part of mine: and I blls God that you
$I injoy your health, which I beeg of you to take care of. I thanke
$I God, Ned is well, and I beeg your bllsing for him: and I pray God
$I preserue you well and giue you a happy and speedy meeting with
$I    Your most faithful affectionat wife,    BRILLIANA HARLEY.
$I    I pray you present my humbell duty to my father, and my lady.
$I    My cosen Thomkins remembers her loue to you.
$I Brompton, the 17 of Mar. 1625.
