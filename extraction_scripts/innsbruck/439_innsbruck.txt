$I Madam,
$I I am at last come to Adderbury, where I find none but the
$I housekeeper, the butler and rats who squeak mightily and are
$I all in good health. Your daughter our next-door neighbour is
$I well; I gave her your present which she received handsomely.
$I Your maids for good husbandry and equipage sake I would
$I have sent you from tithing to tithing, as the law of England

<p. 101

$I allows, but Florence was gentle and penitent and deserves
$I something better. I have given her counsel for one end and
$I a soft pillion for the other, upon which she ambles to Somerset_shire,
$I where I am glad to hear your ladyship is, I hope in good
$I health, at this present writing. Your other maid is a very
$I eloquent person and I have paid her wages. Tomorrow I intend
$I for Woodstock and from thence to London, where I hope to
$I receive your commands. Present my humble duty to my Lady
$I Warre, whose favours will ever be in my grateful memory; my
$I humble service to Lady La Warre, to cousin Betty, sweet honey,
$I Mrs Windham, the sprite, and the little girl whom my soul
$I loveth. I hope my brother is well, but it is not usual to present
$I our service to men in ladies' letters, so like a well-bred
$I gentleman I rest,
$I                         Madam,
$I                           Your humble servant,
$I                            Rochester.
$I If you are pleased, I am pleased; were my mother pleased, all
$I were pleased, which God be pleased to grant.
$I                         Rochester.
