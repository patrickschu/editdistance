<Sir Francis Drake to Walsyngham (1588),
<The Defeat of the Spanish Armada, ed. Laughton, vol. II, pp. 146-149.

$I   Right Honourable:  The uncertainty of the
$I reports which daily come unto us out of Calais,
$I Dunkirk, Ostend, Flushing, from my Lord of Hun_tingdon,
$I Scotland, and such ships and pinnaces
$I which have been sent out for discovery by my Lord
$I Admiral, make me rather to rest upon mine own

<p. 147

$I conjecture than upon any of them, they disagreeing
$I so much as they do; the one affirming that the
$I Duke of Sidonia, with his fleet, is coming back again,
$I that the Duke of Parma is marching presently to
$I embark to be conducted by him; the other affirm_ing
$I that it is for certain that the fleet of Spain is
$I past without Scotland for their way homewards.
$I Which reports are quite contrary.
$I   My poor opinion is, that if their fleet chance to
$I return, it is altogether for that the wind will not
$I permit them good passage to go about the other way
$I at this time of the year, because it is most subject to
$I westerly winds. This wind that now bloweth, if it
$I be not more easterly there than it is here, could
$I hardly permit such a fleet, for that they shall feel a
$I great wind, for to set sail to pass on the back side [of]
$I Scotland and Ireland, which may be the cause that of
$I necessity they must be forced this way for Spain.
$I   Farther, my judgment [is] that the Duke of
$I Sidonia, [with] his fleet, shall [needs] jump with fair
$I weather, the highest of a spring, [with] good wind,
$I and the Duke of Parma embarKing all in one day.
$I This were very meet for them; for if any one of these
$I fail them, they shall never perform as much as they
$I have promised to the King, their master. My
$I reason is this. The most part of the ships of the
$I Duke of Parma are small, and, being pestered with
$I men of war, must of necessity have fair weather; and
$I  as I am credibly given to understand  they must
$I have a spring to bring their shipping both out of
$I Dunkirk, Nieuport, and Sluys.
$I   Now, for the Duke of medina his fleet, there is
$I [no] harbour for them upon that coast, so that to
$I stir it requireth fair weather; which, when it happen
$I that we should find there, he is like, God will_ing,
$I to have unquiet rest. And yet, with my consent,

<p. 148

$I we ought much more to  have regard unto the Duke
$I of Parma and his soldiers than to the Duke of
$I Sidonia and his ships, for that our sands will take a
$I strong party with us against his great ships, under
$I water. My poor opinion is that the Duke of Parma
$I should be vigilantly looked upon for these 20 days,
$I although the army of Spain return not this way; for
$I of them I have no great doubt, although there be
$I great cause for us all to watch carefully and defend
$I mightily those many and proud enemies which seek
$I to supplant the most honourable crown of England
$I from our most gracious Sovereign, whom God de_fend,
$I as he hath most graciously done for his great
$I mercy's sake.
$I   I would advertise your Honour of some defects
$I in her Majesty's army, but that my very good Lord,
$I the Lord Admiral, hath written unto your Honour
$I thereof at large.
$I   This is my poor opinion of her Majesty's [army],
$I that the [threatening] of the enemy will put a great
$I part of [their] weakness from her Majesty's good
$I subjects, and no doubt but they will fight valiantly.
$I although  I [find] my Lord Admiral well affected,
$I when fair weather [is], to go for the coast of Flanders,
$I yet I would your Honour should animate us for_ward;
$I for there are many causes that might move
$I us to be there more than we are, and much better
$I for us, and better service. Thus humbly taking
$I my leave of your Honour, I rest desiring God to
$I give us all grace to live in his fear, so shall we not
$I need greatly to fear the enemy. From aboard her
$I Majesty's very good ship the Revenge, this 23rd of
$I August, 1588.
$I    Your Honour's most willing to be commanded,
$I                                     FRA. DRAKE.

<p. 149

$I   I have sent to your Honour a copy, Englished,
$I out of a letter sent from Don Pedro de Valdes to the
$I [King his master], which doth deliver the time of
$I their victualling, and of some discontentment which
$I was between the Duke and him.
$I   Let me humbly beseech your Honour that we
$I may be put in mind here that it were good we saw
$I the coast of Flanders as often as we might. I think
$I it one of the best services we can have in hand. It
$I must be known I have written thus much to your
$I Honour. God bless us all, and give us grace to
$I fear his justice.
$I    I crave pardon. I have no time to read that
$I which I have caused to be written.
$I                         Your Honour's faithfully,
$I                                          FRA. DRAKE.
