$I friends ye Kingdome has a loss in such a person and
$I everyone y=t= was happie in knowing of him. I am sur my
$I poore selfe has lost a very kind good friend ye best is I
$I am soe neare going ye same way soone, w=ch= must help to
$I make all things more indifferent to me whilst I am upon
$I earth. I have made all ye inquiries I could after you, and
$I doe heare you have some of your relations gone to you I
$I would most willingly have come myselfe but I feared

$I to myself as to make ye earliest offer to you.
