$I DEAR CORNWALLIS,
$I I KNOW that by this tyme I have deserved and
$I undergonne much of your censuer, if I have not
$I lost all your favor; which to redeem I do protest
$I unto you that the only cause you have binne so
$I long without hearing from me was, that I was
$I ashamed to send till I could retorne you that part
$I of your wealth you have so long binne pleased to
$I trust me with; to whom alone I had binne be_holding
$I for a curtesy of this natur. Now, if you
$I be so crewell as you cannot forgive me this fault,

<p. 72

$I please yourselfe in imposeing any punishment on
$I me you thinke my offence deserves, and I shall
$I willingly undergoe itt, so itt may purchas my
$I pardon, which I affectionatly beg, under promis
$I never to be a trespasser in this kind againe. I
$I hope to reseave itt signed, by this bearer, who can
$I give you an acount how I have spent my tyme
$I this many months; att whos retorne to me if I
$I might hear that you wold be shortly att London, itt
$I wold bring an infinit deale of contentment to
$I     Your most faithfully loveing freind,
$I L. BEDFORD.

$I Leister, this 12th of September [1620].
$I To my worthy and dear freind the La. Cornewallis.
