$I 'To the Mayor, &c. of Colchester, By Captain Dodsworth:
$I                        These.'
$I Gentlemen,                    'Cambridge,' 23d March 1642.
$I    Upon the coming down of your Townsmen to Cam_bridge,
$I Captain Langley not knowing how to dispose
$I of them, desired me to nominate a fit Captain: which
$I I did,  an honest, religious, valiant Gentleman, Cap_tain
$I Dodsworth, the Bearer hereof.
$I    He hath diligently attended the service, and much
$I improved his men in their exercise; but hath been un_happy
$I beyond others in not receiving any pay for him_self,
$I and what he had for his soldiers is out long ago.

<p. 138

$I    He hath, by his prudence, what with fair and winning
$I carriage, what with money borrowed, kept them to_gether.
$I He is able to do so no longer: they will pre_sently
$I disband if a course be not taken.
$I    It's a pity it should be so! For I believe they are
$I brought into as good order as most Companies in the
$I Army. Besides, at this instant, there is great need to
$I use them; I have received a special command from my
$I Lord General, To advance with what force we can, to
$I put an end, if it may be, to this Work,  God so as_sisting,
$I from whom all help cometh.
$I    I beseech you, therefore, consider this Gentleman,
$I and the soldiers; and if it be possible, make up his
$I Company a Hundred-and-twenty; and send them away
$I with what expedition is possible. It may, through
$I God's blessing, prove very happy. one month's pay
$I may prove all your trouble. I speak to wise men: 
$I God direct you.   I rest,
$I                       Yours to serve you,
$I                               Oliver Cromwell. 
