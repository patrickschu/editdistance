$I   This is the creddens made to my lord the priour of Durame
$I and the cowent anent Aldcambos. Qwhar it is said that the
$I Priour of Coldynhgame, the qwilk Gode assoll3he, walde nocht
$I assent to the said chang of that accione, thir ewydents beris
$I witness, & therto I rafer you, and awssa to dan Johne Penscher
$I that had the thaiths of the said priour of Coldynhame, and
$I to the Priour and the cowent of Durame. And awssa I am
$I enformit be ane of law and reputacion of this land that qwhar
$I condiscionis is made and endentyd befor notabill witnes aws
$I wil unsellit as sellit, the convencion sall be kepit of
$I baycht the partis aws well as thai war selit and entyrchangit
$I wycht ther awne hands. And suppose the ewydents war undon,
$I or frawdfully away haldyn, the witnes beand of life sall ber
$I all the effec of the said ewydents, so that the condiscion sal be
$I hall in the slese aftyr as thai war acordit. And as twechand
$I the convencion of Ald cambos I sal not forga it and condiscion
$I be kepit at the lest, the qwhilk I thynk not to ga fra qwhill I
$I hafe browcht it tyl enend, qwha sa ever trast the contrar. And
$I alswa, as to the Priour of Coldynghame and the gowernanc of
$I the place and the fredom therof, sen the said Priour and I com
$I fra Durame he wald never be gowernit be my counsell in na
$I matter, na be my ordinanc, bot as S=r= Alexand Hom wald
$I enforme hyme. And sen Sr Alexand Hom was at discussion
$I with me the said Priour has don als his besines, as I am enformit,
$I to forthir the said Sr Alexander to his purpos in contrar of me
$I and nt lukand to the awale na the fredom of the hows na to
$I my lawte as I am bown, the qwilk lawte I sal kep for ony perall
$I that may aper, God willande, as I sal answer and mak knawn
$I to the hows & to you. And for to forthir the said S=r= Alexandre

<p. 141

$I the said Prior has put the hows in peral, as is weill kend, to
$I the cuntre, & for this caws I seand the perall aper, I have
$I takyn the strencht of the hows in gowernanc, becaws I knew
$I wile that the said Sr Alexander wald haf takyne it, and throwe
$I it wald hafe suppleit thaim of Downfirmyllyng, or any other
$I that wald best applie to hys gowernance; and this may well be
$I trowitt be this caws fer I profferit to our frends to be lefit in
$I the samyn plit as I fand it, so that he wald fynd surtre that it
$I sulde be unkepit threw hym or ony that til hym pertenyt, and
$I this he has refwssit, the qwilke I am bown to raquer my said
$I lord the Priour and the cowent of Duram that the said Priour
$I of Coldyngham his langag na wrytting be na hendering to me
$I na to my matres, qwill he and I apper in propyr persons befor
$I the chapatur and al the brether that best knawis my gowern_ment,
$I the qwilk apperans sal not be lang to wt myne assent, w=t=
$I the grace of God. And on this Sonday in sklandyng of
$I me he passit to Sant Ebbis, and gert his brether and the parys_prest
$I pas witht hym, and wald lat na mese be said na ser_vice
$I done to the parishyne withing the kyrk of Coldyngham,
$I and I was not content therof & com to Coldyngham the sam
$I Sonday, lat at evyne, and spak sumqwhatt with dene John
$I Pencher for a pair of evidences that was in makyng betuex the
$I said Priour & Sr Alexandr of Hum of xv yher tak of Alcombos;

$I langaig he hastit hym the souner, and passit on the nycht,
$I foroute lef takyng, and tuk all his brethir wyth hym that was
$I in Coldyngham. And quar it was said to yhou that I pourpost
$I me to bige a tour in Aldcambos, and had laid stanis on the
$I grounde, it is not sua, for trewly I na my son was never pour_post
$I theron, bot thai that made that lagang first, it was for
$I fourtheryng of thaim self and hyndryng of me. Quharfor I

$I that sal ber witness therto. And of all thir materis, quhat tym

<p. 142

$I that I & my sone commys to yhour lordschipp, we will be mar
$I rewlit be yhou & yhout chapiter than be ony that leffs, for we
$I haf ever ben mekil behaldyn therto. And of ony discorde that
$I is betuix the Priour of Coldyngham and his brethir that ther is
$I and me I sal be ful laicht that it be hard ... ... quhill
$I I cum to yhour presens, sa that he gef na tak til S=r= Alex of
