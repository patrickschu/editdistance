$I MY MOST HONORED LADY,
$I THOUGH I writ soe latlye by the carier, that my
$I letters will tread upon one another's heeles, yet I
$I coulde not negleckt the presenting of my seruis to
$I you, hauing soe fitt a messenger as Sr Fredrick's
$I man, which he sent to me; but him selfe I saw not
$I sins the day he came to London from Brome,
$I therfore can say nothing of him, but that I hope
$I he continewes in the same minde and dutifull re-_speckt
$I to you that he profest the last time I spake
$I with him. I cannot but hope to see you at Lon-_don
$I shortly, where I feare I shall be inforsed to
$I stay till the end of next tearme, to se if I can
$I bring my mother's busines to some thing, for yet
$I we have done littil, by reson my Lady Weston was
$I out of toune and soe could never come to have my
$I Lord and shee together. I am in hope to bring
$I my housband at last to the busines you sent for
$I him to Brome, for conserning his eastate; which
$I if he doe, I shall thinke it worth my jornye, and
$I when it is done I shall wish my selfe with you.
$I In the meane time, where soeuer I am, I am and
$I euer will be, Your Ladiship's faithfull frend
$I and humble seruant,
$I          DOROTHE RANDOLPH.
$I [1631-2.]
$I To my most honored frend the Lady Bacon.
