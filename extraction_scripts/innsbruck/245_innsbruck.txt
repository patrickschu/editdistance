$I    Noble Lord,
$I      I haue so confirm'd Opinion of yo=r= vertue, And am so
$I fortified in myne owne Innocence, as I dare (without blushinge
$I at any thinge saue your Trouble) put my Fame into youre hands: 
$I which I prefer to my lyfe. The cause of my commyttment

<p. 197

$I I vnderstand is his Maiesties high displeasure conceyued against
$I me; ffor w=ch= I am most Inwardlie sorie; but how I should deserue
$I it, I haue yet I thanke God so much integritie as to doubt. If I
$I haue bene misreported to his Maiestie, the punishment I now
$I suffer may I hope merite more of his Princelye fauoure, when he
$I shall know me trulie; Euerie accusation doth not condemne. And
$I there must goe much more to the makinge of a guiltie man, then
$I Rumor. I therfore craue of yo=r= Lo: this Noble Benefitt, rightly
$I to informe his Maiestie, y=t= I neuer in thought, worde, or Act, had
$I purpose to offend or grieue him, but w=th= all my powers haue studied
$I to shew my selfe most loyall and zealous to his whole disseignes
$I y=t= in priuate and publique, by speech and writinge, I haue euer
$I profest it, And if there be one man, or deuill to be produc'd y=t=
$I can affirm the contrarie, let me suffer under all extremitie, y=t=
$I Iustice, nay Tyrannye can inflict; I speake not this w=th= any
$I spiritt of Contumacie, for I know there is no subiect hath so safe
$I an Innocence, but may reioyce to stand iustified in sight of his
$I Soueraignes mercie. to which we must humblie submytt our
$I selues, our liues and fortunes.
$I                                         Ben Johnson.
