$I           June 18. 78.
$I Gentlemen, my very worthy friends,
$I    Yesterday the House of Common past the Bill for exportation of
$I Leather and sent it up to the Lords. They then receiued the Report
$I of the Accounts of the 200000=li= taken upon the Clause for Credit upon
$I the Excise & voted first upon a Diuision of 139 to 131. That it doth
$I appeare to this House that an 160000=li= hath been borrowed on the
$I Excise & hath been expended on the extraordinary charge of the
$I Navy. Next, upon Diuision of 149. to 142. That it appears that
$I 40000=li= hath been borrowed on the Excise & expended for the ex_traordinary
$I charge of the Ordinance in the yeare 1677. To day
$I being the last on which any new motion could be made for supply his
$I M=ty= commanded the House to wait on him in the House of Lords
$I when he spoke long to them but it hath been impossible for me to
$I send you a Copy of the Speech, the House having sate all day till seven
$I in the Euening. But the most remarkable point was that his M=ty=
$I desired beside these supplyes already in Prospect, to be further fur_nished
$I with an additionall Revenue for his Life of 300000=li= a yeare, on
$I w=ch= condition he would appropriate 500000=li= a yeare to the Nauy.
$I Also 40000=li= for the Princesse of Orange's portion. And signifyd there
$I might be a Recesse toward the middle of the next month. They
$I first voted Thanks to be presented by the Privy Counsell for the
$I Gracious Expressions in his speech. Then after long Debate they
$I voted without trying the Diuision that they would not go into Commit_tee
$I of the House for raising a Revenue of 300000=li= a yeare for his
$I M=tys= life. Then that they would not consider of any Compensation
$I for the French Prohibition; the Reuenue not hauing as yet suffered
$I by it. This carryed by 202 against 145. But next, to go to morrow
$I into a Committee of the Whole House to consider of the Motion for
$I continuing the imposition on wines; as also of the way of raising the
$I 200000=li= to w=ch= they are obliged and the other 2 or 300000=li= for the
$I Charge of this Fleet, & to consider the Motion for 40000=li= Portion.
$I From hence, these things being thus settled they entred into a great
$I debate of looking into the Privy Seals for secret service since 1 of

<p. 233

$I May -77. & of taking account what Pensions on the Revenue.
$I And then of a Test for the Members that they had not been bribed
$I & a great many heads more. Twas late but carryed not to adjourn
$I by 173. against 103. Then at last the Question was put for a Committee
$I to draw up such a Test. It fell by a Division of 100 to 86. I remaine
$I Gentlemen &c:
$I                         Your most affectionate servant
$I                              Andr: Marvell.
