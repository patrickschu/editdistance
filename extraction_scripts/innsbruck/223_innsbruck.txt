$I My deare Brother, I would you knewe (though not
$I felt) the extreme dolor that overwhelms my mind, for
$I that miserable accident which (far contrary to my
$I meanings) hath befalen. I have now sent this Kins_man

<p. 23

$I of mine whom ere now yt hath pleased yow to 
$I favor, to instruct yow trewly of that which ys to yerk_som
$I for my penne to tell yow. I beseche yow that 
$I as God and many moe knowe, how innocent I am in
$I this case: so you will believe me, that yf I had bid 
$I ought I owld have bid by yt. I am not so bace
$I minded that feare of any livinge creature or prince 
$I should make me afrayde to do that were just, or don
$I to denye the same. I am not of so base a linage, nor 
$I cary so vile a minde. But, as not to disguise, fits not
$I a Kinge, so will I never dissemble my actions, but
$I cawse them shewe even as I ment them. Thus as_suringe
$I yourself of me, that as I knowe this was de_served,
$I yet yf I had ment yt I would never laye yt on 
$I others shoulders; no more will I not damnifie my 
$I selfe, that thought yt not.


$I The circumstance yt may please yow to have of this 
$I bearer. And for your part, thincke yow have not in 
$I the World a more lovinge kinswoman, nor a more 
$I deare frend then my self; nor any that will watch
$I more carefully to preserve yow and your estate. And
$I who shall otherwise perswade yow, judge them more
$I partiall to others then yow. And thus in hast I leave
$I to troble yow: besechinge God to send yow a longe
$I Reign. The 14th of Feb. 1586.
$I Your most assured lovinge sister
$I and cosin
$I Elizab. R.
