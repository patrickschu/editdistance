$I    Deare Wife I receiv'd y=r= three pictures & am in a greate fright
$I least they should bee like you, by the biggnes of y=e= heade I
$I should apprehend you farr gone in y=e= Ricketts, by the severity of
$I the Count'nance, somwhat inclin'd to prayer & prophesy, yett
$I there is an alacrity in the plump cheeke, that seemes to signify
$I sack & sugar, & the sharp sighted nose has borrow'd quickness
$I from the sweete-smelling eye, I never saw a chin smile before, a
$I mouth frowne, & a forehead mump, truly y=e= artist has done his
$I part, (god keep him humble) & a fine man he is if his excel_lencyes
$I doe not puff him up like his pictures; the next imp_ertinence
$I I have to tell you is that I am coming down to you I
$I have gott horses but want a coach when that defect is supply'd
$I you shall quickly have the trouble of
$I                          Yr. humble servant
$I                          Imminent Peril of Sobriety

<p. 97

$I Present my duty to my Lady & my humble service to my Sister,
$I my brother, & alle the Babyes not forgetting Madam Iane.
