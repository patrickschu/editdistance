$I           May. 11. 78.
$I Gentlemen, my very worthy friends,
$I    Yesterday the Committee appointed for that purpose made their
$I Report of this Addresee inclosed. But as soon as it was made, severall
$I Gentlemen moved not to proceed in it further but to expect some
$I information more of the Resolutions to come from Holland. This was
$I long and frequently opposed by others. So that the Debate terminated
$I in a Division of the House, the most numerous that I remember of
$I many years Wherein by 176 against 174 it was carryed to proceed.
$I Then the severall Paragraphs of the Adresse were in order put to the
$I Question and upon two of the most materiall there were two Divisions
$I of the House. The first of 170 against 167. The second of 169 against
$I 166. both carryed in the Affirmative. And the whole Addresse as
$I I send it you was agreed and the Members of the Privy Counsell
$I ordered to desire of his Majesty the time when the House might wait
$I upon him with it. It was then moved that the Houses vote against
$I Duke Lauderdale that his Majesty may further humbly be desird to
$I remove him from his Counsells & presence might be added to this
$I Adresse, the House having rejected the other day the particular forme
$I in which it was drawn up. This admitting a Debate and the House
$I hauing already sate the whole day till fiue a clock, some moved to
$I Adjourne, which came at last to be the Question and the House being
$I Divided upon it, it was carryed by 158 against 150 not to Adjourne.
$I So they proceeded on and it was without any Division more voted to
$I Add him to the Adresse. It happend in one of the former Divisions
$I that on some occasion in the Lobby there were Blows giuen between
$I S=r= Thomas Chichley, Master of the Ordinance & the Lord Obrian
$I though both of the same Party. The House orderd S=r= Thomas who
$I was present & the L: Obrian who absented to be taken into custody
$I of their Sergent at Arms. To day a verball message as from the King
$I was deliverd by Secr: Williamson that he would receive their Addresse

<p. 225

$I in the afternoon & to enter immediately into consideration of a
$I Supply. This last was long debated none being willing to giue a
$I Negative but neither forward to an Affirmative in the uncertainty
$I of War or Peace. Both were avoyded by the Question whether the
$I Debate should be Adjournd w=ch= past by 168 against 167 in the nega_tiue
$I & so fell. They with their Adresse waited since on the King
$I who seemd dissastisfied. God grant better.
$I                                 I am your serv=t=
$I                                     Andr: Marvell.
