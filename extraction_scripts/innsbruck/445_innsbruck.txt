$I Gentlemen, my very Worthy friends,
$I    His Majesty open'd this Session with the Speech which I send you
$I inclosed. And after that the Lord Chancellour spoke at large, but the
$I Copy of it not hauing been communicated to the House of Commons,
$I they appointed a Committee to peruse the Lords Journall for it, where
$I such things are of course to be entred. The Lords have also ordered
$I the Speech to be Printed: so that I suppose one way or other I may
$I by the next Post compasse it for you. The House of Commons opened

<p. 226

$I their session as is usuall with reading a Bill and that which was pitched
$I upon was the former Bill for regulating the Collection of Hearth-mony
$I and then they appointed a day for its second reading. The rest of their
$I time was spent in settling the ordinary affaires of their House appoint_ing
$I days for their Grand Committees, naming and impowring their
$I Committee of Privileges, and renewing the Clause against Bribery or
$I interteinments in order to Elections and lastly in receiving severall
$I Petitions concerning undue Elections. What I remarke in the House
$I is that it is much fuller then ordinary and more are still upon the Road
$I and there seems a more then usuall concernment among all men as if
$I some great and I hope good thing were to be expected. God in his
$I mercy direct all to the best. What I understand thereof I shall from
$I time to time communicate to you, remaining Gentlemen &c:
$I                             Your most affectionate Servant.
$I                                  Andr: Marvell
$I Westm: May 23. 1678
