$I   Syr, I most hertely commend me vn to you, and where as I haue
$I byn somewhat sloo in wrytyng syne I arryuyd hyther to our cuntrey,
$I (where as I bere the ayre bettur then I dyd wyth you in Italy) I wyl
$I now my slaknes therin by the lenghthe of thys in some parte recom_pense
$I the wych I trvst schal no thyng offend you but bryng to you
$I grete plesure & comfort. Syr, as you know syth our fyrst acquynt_ance
$I & famylyaryte many letturys ther hath byn at sundry tymys
$I betwyx vs wryten, and much commvnycacyon ther hath byn also con_cernyng

$I the Instytution of our lyfys, wyth such fydelyte mynystryd
$I apon both partys as was conuenyent to the syncerenes of our hartys
$I & myndys, but yf euer any of thes you haue jugyd to be worthy of
$I remembrance, or yet dow styke in your memory & mynd, I besech you
$I let thes few wordys wych I now to you wryte be put in the nombur
$I of them, wyth gud aduertysement and consyderacyon of the same, for
$I the[y] concerne the hole ordur of your lyfe here aftur to be lade in
$I thys our cuntrey among your natural louerys & frendys. Syr,
$I I was but Late by the synguler gentylnes of Maystur Secretary, wos
$I gudnes bothe toward me & also to you ys so sonke in to my brest, that
$I duryng my lyfe I schal euer reken my selfe next to our prynce aboue
$I al other most faythfully to hym bovnden, for in the court to the
$I kyngys seruyce and by hys most louyng commendacyonys so gracyovsly
$I of hys hyghnes acceptyd & admyttyd that schortly aftur hyt plesyd
$I the same to cal me to hys presence, and ther of you, of your studys,
$I and of your sentence & opynyon in hys gracys most weyghty
$I causys here late defynyd, most louyngly many thyngys to demande;
$I to the wych I made such answere, as euer I haue jugyd conuenyent to
$I be made before the maiesty of a prynce; that ys, such thyngys as I
$I knowe manyfest & true playnly to affyrme, and such wherof I stond
$I in dowte by coniecture only to reherce: and so your mynd, hart &
$I desyre to dow hys grace true & faythful seruyce, wych I know no
$I other wyse then I know myn owne, I boldly dyd affyrme, but as
$I touchyng your opynyon in hys gracys late defynyd causys, one of the
$I matrymony, the other concernyng the authoryte of the pope, for as much
$I as you euer haue vsyd thys prudent sylence neuer to dysclose your
$I sentence & mynd but in tyme & place, I coude not of your opynyon
$I any thyng therin playnly affyrme, but yet thys to hys hyghnes I
$I sayd & suerly I thought, that as fer as your lernyng & jugement, wych
$I I estymyd by tyme & dylygent study somewhat was alteryd &
$I incresyd, also touchyng the dycernyng betwyx goddys law & mannys
$I wold streche & extend, al your powar & al such knolege & lernyng as
$I by the gudnes of god & hys gracys lyberalyte you had obtaynyd &
$I got, to the mayntenyng of such thyngys as hys gracys wysedome by
$I court of parlyament therin had decred, you wold gladly confer to the
$I honowre of hys hyghnes & welth of hys reame.  thys much I sayd,
$I thys fer I went, but hys grace not satysfyd therwyth, desyryng to
$I haue your sentence therin playnly declaryd, commandyd me thys
$I now to wryte to you, that hys plesure was that you schold lyke a lernyd
$I man, al assertyon by any cause rysyng set asyde, in thos ij causys

<p. 15

$I pondur and wey the nature of the thyngys as they be in them selfe,
$I and puttyng a-parte al sucessys & dangerovse effectys wych of them
$I may insue, leuying al such thyngys to hys gracys wysedome & hys
$I pollycy, declare your sentence truly & playn wythout coloure or cloke
$I of dyssymulatyon, (wych hys grace most pryncely abhorryth), not
$I wyllyng you of thes thyngys to make any grete volume or boke but
$I breuely to geddur the most effectual resonys wych in your stomake
$I be of most weyght, & them to set forth aftur your playn fascyon &
$I maner of wrytyng thys was hys gracys plesure & commandement that
$I I schold to you wryte, wych I haue as nere as my memory wold serue
$I me therin truly & faythfylly now to you exerc[y]syd. now, syr,
$I considur and prudently wey how pryncely a request thys ys of oure
$I prynce, and then I am sure you wyl imploy your selfe wyth al
$I dylygence & study to satisfye hys nobul desyre, to the wych also
$I mastur Secretary, (whose most louyng gudnes toward you gyuyth place
$I to no man) mostly gentyly doth exhort you, wyllyng you also in any
$I case, what so euer your sentence in thes causys schal be, to vse your
$I wont & custumyd playnes wyth prudent symplycyte, and me apon hys
$I behalfe thys to certyfye you, that in case be your lernyng & jugement
$I in thes materys of weyght wold strech & extend to the satysfying of
$I the kyngys desyre & mynd, that then your retorne hither to your
$I cvntrey schold be gretely to the kyngys plesure, to your owne comfort,
$I & much profyt to the rest of your frendys; ye and yet ferther, yf so be
$I that your knolege & lernyng wold not serue you to thys purpos &
$I request of the kyng, yet notwythstondyng wold he aduyse you, of a
$I tendur & louyng mynd, to prepare yourselfe at your conuenyent
$I leser toward your cuntrey, dowtyng no thyng but [th]at the kyngys
$I hyghnes in other hys causys & hys affayrys schal vse your seruyce &
$I most louyng & seruysabul mynd. for sory he ys that ther among
$I stravngerys wythout profyt to your cuntrey your vertues schold be so
$I utturly drownyd & lyke as in a dreme vanysch away. wherby, syr,
$I you may playnly perceyue the gentilnes of hys stomake & synguler
$I gudnes to al men of honesty, wych to you almost vnacquaynted & of
$I smal famylyaryte beryth suche mynd, mouyd only by the opynyon of
$I vertue, wych to hym fame hath reportyd, in so much that thys he
$I wyllyd me now by my letturys of hys gudnes and beneuolent mynd,
$I so to assure you, that in al such thyngys as myght touche your
$I preferment to my lady your mother & my lord your brother whome
$I nature so straytly byndyth only he wold gyue place: wherin he

<p. 16

$I schowyth so gentyl a stomake that I dare thys boldly now say that
$I yf euer hereaftur hyt schalbe your chaunce presently here of thys
$I mynd in hym experyence to take, you schal as I dow for hys vertues
$I & not only for hys authoryte haue hym in stabyl & reuerent loue,
$I such ys hys wysedome & in materys of state hys hygh pollycy. and
$I thvs now you haue hard the most prudent aduyse & synguler
$I beneuolence of mastur Secretary, to the wych I dowte not but that
$I wyth grete gladnes you wyl apply yourselfe, wyllyng therby to
$I satysfye our pryncys plesure & desyre. And now, syr, for by-cause syth
$I our last departure out of our cuntrey lytlyl commvnycacyon concern_yng
$I thes materys hathe byn betwyx vs had, I wyl now adioyne thes
$I few wordys vn to you.  (6) Pondur you wel thys leuytycal law & how
$I hyt ys rotyd in the law of nature, and how by general conseyl hyt hath
$I byn many tymys delcaryd & authorysyd therby, and forther how
$I apon the other syde the sklendurnes of thys long vsurpyd & abvsyd
$I authoryte of the pope, wych by pacyence of pryncys, simplycyte of
$I the pepul, & ambycyovse auaryce of hys predecessorys, in processe of
$I tyme by lytyl & lytyl ys growen to thys intollerabul iniquyte, and
$I then I thynk that you schal see in thes cavsys the jugyd truth &
$I playn equyte. But al thys I leue to your owne consyderacyon &
$I jugement, praying to hym, of whome to al men cumyth al lyght, that
$I by hys lyght & grace you may see the truth, & so then to set hyt
$I forth that hyt may be comfort to our prynce, plesure to your selfe
$I and to al other here your louarys & frendys. And thys now, syr, I wyl
$I make an end, fynychyng my letturys wyth comfortabul newys that
$I al such rumor & fame wych by men of corrupt jugement not hauyng
$I dyscretyon to juge & dyscerne betwyx veray and true relygyon & lyght
$I & false superstycyon syth was in Italy you dyuulgyd, ys vtterly false &
$I ful of vanyte. For of this dowte you nothyng, that albehyt apon
$I many resonabul & ivste causys our most nobul prynce hathe wyth_drawen
$I hymselfe from the popys authoryte, yet from the certayn &
$I sure groundys of scrypture hys grace in no poynt ys slyde, no nor yet
$I from the lawys nor ceremonys of the church, the wych yet stond in
$I ful strenghth & authoryte; and so the[y] schal boldly I dare affyrme,
$I vntyl such tyme that to hys hyghnes & to hys most wyse conseyl hyt
$I schal appere expedyent them to abrogate & other to substytute by
$I commyn assent more agreabul to thys tyme and to the nature of our
$I men, & also to our hole cuntry more conuenyent. here ys no thyng
$I downe wythout due ordur & resonabul mean; here ys touchyng

<p. 17

$I relygyon nothyng almost alteryd at al but that wych was of al other
$I most necessary, wych ys, as I trust, & schalbe a veray ground & a
$I foundatyon to cyuyle ordur & a true & ryght pollycy. thys ys the
$I state here, and of thys one thyng I dow you assure, yf I had found
$I truth in dede thes thyngys wych by mysreport ther wyth you were
$I commynly sayd, as that our prynce schold be slypt also from the
$I groundys of scrypture, from the honowre of the sacramentys, & from
$I al the commyn Lawys & holsome ceremonys of the church wythout
$I ordur, I wold neuer haue byn so wythout sense or stomake of an
$I honest man, as at thys tyme to haue sought to entur to hys seruyce;
$I for the desyre wych I haue long nuryschyd in my brest to serue thys
$I our mastur & prynce ys in thys stabyl, & I trust euer schalbe, in hys
$I seruyce to serue god & my cuntrey, to the wych purpos the rest of my
$I lyfe I wyl now dedycate to hys grace & wyth such hart & mynd
$I serue hym wythal as ys conuenyent to a true faythful & chrystyan
$I subiect toward hys most nobul & catholyke prynce: thys ys my mynd
$I & I am sure the same ys yourys, the wych I trvst in factys you schal
$I haue place schortly to declare & thys I commyt you to god.   At
$I London the xv of February,
$I                       By yourys assuryd,
$I                          Thomas Starkey.

<Endorsed
$I               Thomas Starkey to his frend in Italy wishing him to
$I geve his opinyone to the kinges grace touching his oppiniyone for the
$I Altering of Relygeon and the Abolishing of the popes Authoritye.
