$I The Queen of Bohemia to Sir Edward Nicholas.
$I Hagh De: 3. (1654..)
$I Mr. Secretarie, I receaued yours at Berghen, whither I
$I was come from Anwerp and Bruxells. I finde you haue
$I vnridled my riddle verie right. I saw the Queene of Sue_den
$I at the play, she is extrauagant in her fashion and apa_rell,
$I but she has a good well fauoured face, and a milde
$I countenance. One of the players that knew me tolde her
$I who I was, but she made no shew of it. I went the next
$I day to Bruxelles, where I saw the Arch-duc at mass, and I
$I saw his pictures and lodgins. I lay at S=r= Harry de Vics,
$I who was verie carefull and dilligent to doe me all the ser_vice

<p. 207

$I he coulde. I stayed but Sunday at Bruxelles, and
$I returned to Anwerp vpon  Munday, and heearing from
$I Duart how the Queene of Sueden had desired to know when
$I I came back thither, that she might meet with me in an in_diferent
$I place, I made the more hast away the next day
$I because I had no minde to speak with her since I heard how
$I unhandsomelie she had spoken of the King my deare Bro_ther
$I and of the King my deare Nephue, and indeed of all
$I our nation, so I auoided it and went away as soone as I had
$I dined.   Yett she sent Donoy to me with a verie civill mes_sage
$I that she was sorie she coulde not use that ciuilitie to
$I me as she both should doe and desired, hoping that one day
$I wee might meet together with more freedome; I answered
$I her as civillie as I coulde, and now when I went from Berg_hen
$I I gaue S=r= Will: Swann charge to make her a comple_ment
$I from me.   I came hither vpon Tewsday from Berghen,
$I where I was extremelie well intertained by the Princess of
$I Zolern who was with me and was my guide all the iour_ney,
$I and defrayed me. her daughter is now so prettie
$I euerie way that you would like her yet better than euer you
$I did if you saw her; she is much growen and is still of a
$I verie sweet disposition, and she doth become her: she has a
$I great deal of witt and loues our nation extreamlie, it makes
$I me think of your wishe which I ame not against you
$I know.  by this post I haue had verie good news of the Duke
$I of Glocesters constantie in his religion and of my Lo: of
$I rmonds handsome carriage in that business, so as the

<p. 208

$I Queen saith she will press him no further in it, but I hope
$I the King will not trust to it, but gett him away from thence,
$I which will doe the King great right: it is so colde as I can
$I say no more, but ame euer
$I Your most affectionat frend.
$I I pray excuse me to my Lo. Wentworth and reverent
$I Dick Harding till the next.
$I "For M=r= Secretarie."
$I 3 Dec: St:No: 1645 R. 6=o=. The Queene of Bohemia con=g=
$I her iourney to see the Qu. of Sweeden.
