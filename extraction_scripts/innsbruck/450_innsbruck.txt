$I June XI, [1679].
$I D.S.,
$I    You may remember I writt unto you some weekes
$I since concerning a gentleman Mr Austine Blennerhaysett,
$I commonly called Mr. Hayset or Hasset; his buisinesse
$I hath hindred his Journey then intended. Butt hee in_tendeth
$I God willing to bee in London on Tuesday next.
$I I presume you have my letter wch I then writt; pray
$I peruse it, and knowe that hee sayth hee hath had some
$I gleeting at the penis at times a great while; hee came
$I about Michaelmas last to Dr Blincolne and myself and
$I hee tooke some mercuriall medicines and decoctions and
$I dyet drincks and grewe well, as hee sayd, only I under_stand
$I from him that hee is not free from gleeting some_times
$I and also hath some inabillity as to erection.
$I Therefore I would have you to vewe the penis diligently,
$I and you may also take in my Cosen Hobbs; hee will staye
$I about 3 weekes if thought fitt for the use of any medi_cines
$I or course. Hee intendeth to marry, and hath settled
$I affection upon a good gentlewoeman and is in a manner
$I agreed, butt it were fitt hee should be in such a state of
$I body as might bee safe and congruus unto both. Con_sider
$I therefore well of it and do all with the best secresy
$I possible, for hee is very Jealous and apt to bee meticulous,
$I and is hypochondricall. Hee is a fayre conditioned
$I gentleman and hath a prettie good estate and not unlikely
$I to bee ungratefull, wherefore bee carefull of him and
$I kind unto him and render to answer his doubts, and not
$I to discourage him.
$I    You say your booke is like to bee reprinted, probably
$I the first part, not the second, which was printed since.
$I Some additions would bee made; I writt one to you
$I concerning Hippocrates that hee practised in Thessalie
$I and mentions divers patients of Larissa, and therefore

<p. 134

$I looke out that paper, and if you have lost it give mee
$I notice for that is a materiall observation especially unto
$I physitians and schollars.
$I    Tis an odde passage concerning the French Kings
$I getting Savoy and Piedmont into his hand for money,
$I and it will concerne many States and make them looke
$I about them. Though hee had a good army, yet tis
$I thought hee hath prevayled much by his money in all
$I the warre and current of his affayres.
$I    The rising in scotland falls out unhappily at this time,
$I many will wish that the parliament were sitting, butt some
$I Jealous people will thinck that this may rather hinder
$I their sitting.
$I    I am glad the buisinesse succeeded so well at Halstead
$I in Kent. Miles about London are short and 4 horses go
$I farre in a summers daye. Sr Joseph Ash, whose daughter
$I my Lord Townshend marryed, is a parliament man, butt
$I of the West country and about Bristowe. I knewe well
$I one Mr. Abraham Ashe who was a Russia marchant, who
$I dyed neere XXX yeares since, perhaps hee might bee
$I related unto this familie; it was a good recountre to
$I meet with Mr. Ash who had travelled in those parts
$I which you have discribed, and if hee had read them
$I might have been some light and information unto them.
$I Mr. Soames may bee recalled from Turine since the prince
$I is dealing with the French about it. Have a care of your
$I health this hott season. Tom presents his duty. Love and
$I blessing to my daughter Browne and you all.
$I                              Y.L.F. 
$I                            T.B.
