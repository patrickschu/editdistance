$I the next posst send me word when I may expect you, and
$I how far you would have my choch to meet you. I heare
$I a flying report of your being to be married, but to whom

$I that assumes a very sensible trouble to - YOURS.
$I Direct your letters to Derby to be sent to Bredbye.
$I For the Lady Giffard at Mr.
$I Wing's house over aginst
$I new street and in St.
$I Martin's Lane, London.
