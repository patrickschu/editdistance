$I London, 15th June, 1688.
$I Dear Sir,
$I    Soon after the writing of the 5th instant to you,
$I I was taken ill of a disease that of late has been almost universal
$I in the town, which fell into my eyes, and disabled me for all
$I manner of business for a considerable time. But I can now
$I inform you that I have spoken with Mr. Oakley, who tells me

<p. 276

$I that he pursued Adrian's orders with a blind obedience in that
$I affair relating to R.B., and by letter hath given you a particular
$I account thereof. But by his discourse I have reason to doubt
$I that matter was not managed exactly pursuant to the method
$I directed by you; but all being over before my return to town,
$I I was therby altogether disabled from serving you in that affair,
$I as otherwise I should have done. Mr. Oakley goes not out of
$I town until monday next, but gives his service to you and desires
$I to know if you have received his letter. As to your affair with
$I Mr. Stringer touching your picture, I have seriously considered
$I all parts of it, and without partiality do assure you, that I cannot
$I find anything blameable in any of your proceedings therein,
$I and therefore as opportunity serves I will use my utmost skill
$I and interest to make Mr. Stringer sensible thereof, and put an
$I end to the contest if it be to be done. And what further I may
$I be sensible to you in shall at all times be faithfully and willingly
$I performed by
$I                         Your most affectionate humble servant,
$I                          E.... 
$I    Your old friend Nath. Hodges will be in town the latter end
$I of this week, and he shall have the only remaining abrégé‚
$I delivered to him as you desire, etc.
$I    Mr. Cheswell hath paid all home to Christmas last, etc.
$I    Madam and the young fry are well, and give you their best
$I service, etc.
$I [Addr.]: For Mr. John Locke, These.
