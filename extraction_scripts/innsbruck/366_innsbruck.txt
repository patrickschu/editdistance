$I To my beloved Cousin Mrs. St. John, at Sir William Masham his
$I           House called Otes, in Essex: Present these.
$I      DEAR COUSIN,          Ely, 13th October 1638.
$I    I thankfully acknowledge your love in your kind
$I remembrance of me upon this opportunity. Alas, you
$I do too highly prize my lines, and my company, I may be
$I ashamed to own your expressions, considering how un_profitable
$I I am, and the mean improvement of my talent.
$I    Yet to honour my God by declaring what He hath
$I done for my soul, in this I am confident, and I will
$I be so. Truly, then, this I find: That He giveth springs
$I in a dry barren wilderness where no water is. I live,
$I you know where, - in Meshec, which they say signi_fies
$I Prolonging; in Kedar, which signifies Blackness:
$I yet the Lord forsaketh me not. Though He do prolong,
$I yet He will I trust bring me to His tabernacel, to His
$I resting-place. My soul is with the Congregation of the
$I Firstborn, my body rests in hope; and if here I may

<p. 99

$I honour my God either by doing or by suffering, I shall
$I be most glad.
$I    Truly no poor creature hath more cause to put him_self
$I forth in the cause of his God than I. I have had
$I plentiful wages beforehand; and I am sure I shall ne_ver
$I earn the least mite. The Lord accept me in His
$I Son, and give me to walk in the light,  and give us
$I to walk in the light, as He is the light! He it is that
$I enlighteneth our blackness, our darkness. I dare not
$I say, He hideth His face from me. He giveth me to
$I see light in His light. One beam in a dark place hath
$I exceeding much refreshment in it:  blessed be His
$I Name for shining upon so dark a heart as mine! You know
$I what my manner of life hath been. Oh, I lived
$I in and loved darkness, and hated light; I was a chief,
$I the chief of sinners. This is true: I hated godliness,
$I yet God had mercy on me. O the riches of His mercy!
$I Praise Him for me;  pray for me, that He who hath
$I begun a good work would perfect it in the day of Christ.
$I    Salute all my friends in that Family whereof you
$I are yet a member. I am much bound unto them for
$I their love. I bless the Lord for them; and that my
$I Son, by their procurement, is so well. Let him have
$I your prayers, your counsel; let me have them.
$I    Salute your Husband and Sister from me:  He
$I is not a man of his word! He promised to write about
$I Mr. Wrath of Epping; but as yet I receive no letters:
$I  put him in mind to do what with conveniency may
$I be done for the poor Cousin I did solicit him about.
$I    Once more farewell. The Lord be with you: so prayeth
$I          Your truly loving Cousin,
$I                          OLIVER CROMWELL. 
