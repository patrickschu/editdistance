$I have seen hym a great while. And now, Madam,

$I as you shall find us in love reddy to perform all
$I things as we have spoaken unto you, so shall
$I I not cease to praye unto the Lorde Almighty
$I for the increase of faythfull love between you
$I with all spiritual graces and happiness in this
$I life, and in the life to come, endles felicity to you
$I and yours, in the presence of the Blessed Trinity,
$I whear is fulnes of joy, and at whose right hand are
$I unspeakable pleasures for evermore. And if it
$I shall please you to take Culford in your returne
$I from London, you shall be most entirely welcom
$I and I shall much rejoyce in it; and Nath. will
$I meete you on the way to direct you thether.
$I And thus, good Lady, with more trew love in
$I hart then I can expresse in words, I leave you
$I to the blessed direction of Almighty God, and

$I ANNE BACON.
