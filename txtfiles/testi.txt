Chambers & Daunt, pp. 33-37.$N   To the most noble and worthiest Lords, most rightful$N and wisest council to our liege Lord the King, complain, if$N it likes to you, the folk of the Mercery of London, as a$N member of the same city, of many wrongs subtles and also$N open oppressions, done to them by long time here before$N passed.$N   Of which one was where the election of Mayoralty is to be to$N the free men of the City by good and peaceable advise of the wisest$N and truest at one day in the year freely, there notwithstanding$N the same freedom or franchise, Nichol Brembre with his upbearers$N purposed him, the year next after John Northampton, Mayor of$N the same city with strong hand, as it is full known, and$N through debate and stronger party against the peace before purveyed$N was chosen Mayor in destruction of many right.$N   For in the same year the foresaid Nichol, without need,$N aye in the peace made diverse inarmings by day and eke/*also by$N night and destroyed the king's true lieges, some with open$N slaughter, some by false imprisonment, and some fled the$N city for fear as it is openly known.$N   And so furthermore, for to sustain these wrongs and many$N other, the next year after, the same Nichol, against the foresaid$N freedom and true communes, did cry openly that no man$N should come to choose their mayor but such as were *assembled, and though$N that were *assembled, were of his ordinance and after his advice.$N And in the night next after following he did carry great$N quantity of armour to the Guildhall, with which as well$N strangers of the country as others of within were armed on$N the morning, against his own proclamation that was such that$N no man should be armed; and certain ambushments were laid,$N that, when free men of the city came to choose their mayor,$N broke up armed crying with loud voice 'sle! sle!' following$N him; wherethrough the people for fear fled to houses and other$N hidings as in land of war, adread to be dead in commune.$N   And thus yet hitherward has the Mayoralty been held as it$N were of conquest or mastery, and many other offices also. So$N that what man privé/*secretly or apart/*openly in special, that he might wit/*know,$N grouching complained or held against any of his wrongs, or by<p. 34$N putting forth of whom so it were, were it never so unprovable,$N were appeached/*accused, and it were displeasing to him Nichol, anon/*at once was$N imprisoned. And, though it were/*was against falsehood of the least$N officer that him lust maintain, was held untrue liege man$N of our king; for who reproved such an officer, maintained$N by him, of wrong or else, he forfeited against him, Nichol, and he,$N unworthy as he said, represented the king's estate. Also if any$N man by cause of service or other leeful/*permissable commandment approached$N a lord, to which lord he, Nichol, dread his falsehood to be$N known to, anon was impeached that he was false to the council$N of the city, and so to the King.$N   And if in general his falseness were againsaid, as of us$N together of the Mercery or other crafts, or any council would$N have taken to againstand it, or as time out of mind has been$N used, would accompany together, how lawful so it were for our$N need or profit, were anon impeached for risers against the peace,$N and falsely many of us, that yet stood indicted. And we been/*are$N openly dis-sclaundered/*disgraced, held untrue and traitors to our King,$N for the same Nichol said before Mayor, aldermen, and our craft$N before him gathered in place of record, that 20 or 30 of us$N were worthy to be drawn and hanged, the which thing like to$N your worthy Lordship by an even judge to be proved or$N disproved, the whether that truth may show, for truth$N among us to few or else no man many day dorst/*dare be shown.$N And not only unshown or hidden it has been by man now,$N but also of before time the most profitable points of true$N governance of the city, compiled together by long labour of$N discrete and wise men, without counsel of true men, for they$N should not be known ne/*nor continued, in the time of Nichol$N Exton, Mayor, outerliche/*utterly were brent/*burned.$N   And so far-forth falsehood has been used that of time he,$N Nichol Brembre, said in sustenance of his falsehood our liege$N lord's will was such that never was such, as we suppose. He<p. 35$N said also, when he had de-sclaundred/*disgraced us, which of us would$N yield him false to his king, the king should do him grace,$N cherish him and be good lord to him. And if any of us all,$N that with God's help have and shall be found true, was so$N hardy to proffer/*offer proving of him self true, anon was commanded$N to prison as well by the Mayor that now is as of him, Nichol$N Brembre, before.$N   Also we have been commanded oft/*many time/*times up our liegeance to$N unneedful and unleeful/*unpermissable diverse doings. And also to withdraw$N us, by the same commandment, from things needful and leeful/*permissable, as$N was shown when a company of good women, their men dorst/*dared$N not, travel barefoot to our liege lord to search grace of$N him for true men as they supposed, for then were such$N proclamations made that no man ne/*nor woman should approach$N our liege lord for searching of grace, and over-many other$N commandments also before and since, by suggestion and information$N of such that would not her falseness/*falsehood had been known to$N our liege lord. And lords, by your leue/*leave, our liege lord's$N commandment to simple and unknowing men is a great thing to$N be used so familiarly without need, for they, unwise to$N save it, move lightly there against forfeit.$N   For that, gracious lords, like it to you to take heed in what$N manner and where our liege lord's power has been misused$N by the foresaid Nichol and his upbearers, for since these wrongs$N before said have been used as accidental or commune branches$N outward, it shows well the route of him is a ragged subject or$N stock inward, that is the foresaid Brere or Brembre, the which$N common wrong uses, and many other, if it like to you, may be$N shown and well known by an indifferent judge and mayor of our$N city; the which with your rightful lordship granted for$N most principal remedy, as God's law and all reason will,$N that no domesman stand together judge and party, wrongs shall$N more openly be known and truth dare appear. And else, as$N among us, we can not wit/*know in what manner without<p. 36$N a much greater disease, since the governance of this city$N stands as it is before said, and will stand while vittaillers/*foragers by$N suffrance presume thilke/*the same states upon him, the which governance$N of, before this time to much folk hidden, shows him$N self now open/*openly whether it has been a cause or beginning of$N division in the city and after in the realm, or not.$N   Wherefore for greatest need as to you, most worthy most$N rightful and wisest lords and council to our liege lord the$N king, we beseech meekly of your grace correction of all$N the wrongs before said, and that it like to your lordship$N to be gracious men to our liege lord the king, that such$N wrongs be known to him, and that we may show us and since$N been held such true men to him as we been and owe to be.$N   Also we beseech unto your gracious lordship that, if any of$N us in special or general be impeached to our liege lord or to his$N worthy counsel by communing with others or approching to$N our king, as with Brembre or his abettors with any wrong$N witness bearing, as that it stands otherwise amongst us here$N than as it is now proved it has stood, or any other wrong$N suggestion by which our liege lord has been unleeffullich/*unpermissably$N informed, that then your worshipful lordship be such that$N we may come in answer to excuse us. For we know well as for$N by much the more party of us, and, as we hope, for all, all$N such wrongs have been unknown to us or else utterly against$N our will. And, rightful lords, for one the greatest remedy$N with others for to again-stand/*stand against many of thilke/*the same diseases before said$N amongst us, we pray with mekeness this especially that the$N statute ordained and made by Parliament held at Westminster in$N the sixth year of our King now reigning may stand in$N strength and be executed, as well here in London as else where$N in the realm,, the which is this: LAT_Item LAT_ordinatum LAT_est LAT_et LAT_statutum$N LAT_quod, etc., etc.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 2<Author(s)/writer(s): Aldermen of London (group)<Place of author: London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: var<Status of author: bourgeois<Recipient: King Henry V<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: noblest King etc.; you<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: upwards<Exact date: 1417<Century (in quarters): 1/15<Educational background: educated<Dialect: London<The Aldermen of London to King Henry V (1417),<A book of London English, eds.

I pray the Holy Trinity, Lord of your church$N and of all the world, deliver me of my 3 adversaries: of this$N cursed bishop for Bromholm, Aslak for Sprouston, and Julian$N Herberd for Thornham. I have not trespassed against none of$N these iii, God knows; and yet I am foul and noisingly vexed$N with them to my great unease, and all for my lords' and friends'<p. 2$N matters and not for my own.

Raine, pp. 140-142.$N   This is the credence made to my lord the prior of Durham$N and the convent anemned/*named Aldcambos. Where it is said that the$N Prior of Coldingham, the which God assoil/*absolve from sin, would not$N assent to the said change of that action, there evidence bears$N witness, and thereto I refer you, and also to Dan John Penscher$N that had  the oaths of the said prior of Coldingham, and$N to the Prior and the convent of Durham. And also I am$N informed by one of law and reputation of this land that where$N conditions are made and indented before notable witness as$N will unselled/*unsold as selled/*sold, the convention shall be kept of$N both the parties as well as they were sold and interchanged$N with their own hands. And suppose the evidence were undone,$N or fraudfully away held, the witness beand/*being of life shall bear$N all the effect of the said evidence, so that the condition shall be$N all in the sleight/*cunning after as they were accorded. And as touching$N the convention of Old Cambos I shall not forget it and condition$N be kept at the least, the which I think not to go from while I$N have brought it to an end, who so ever trest/*trust the contrary. And$N also, as to the Prior of Coldingham and the governance of$N the place and the freedom thereof, then the said Prior and I come$N from Durham he would never be governed by my counsel in a$N matter, nor by my ordinance, but as Sir Alexander Home would$N inform him. And since Sir Alexander Home was at discussion$N with me the said Prior has done as his business, as I am informed,$N to further the said Sir Alexander to his purpose in contrary of me$N and not looking to the avail nor the freedom of the house nor to$N my loyalty that I am bound, the which loyalty I shall keep for any peril$N that may appear, God willing, as I shall answer and make known$N to the house and to you. And for to further the said Sir Alexander<p. 141$N the said Prior has put the house in peril, as is well kend/*known, to$N the country, and for this cause I send the peril appear, I have$N taken the strength of the house in governance, because I knew$N well that the said Sir Alexander would have taken it, and through$N it would have supplied them of Downfirmyllyng, or any other$N that would best apply to his governance; and this may well be$N trowen/*believed by this cause for I proffered to our friends to be left in$N the same plight as I found it, so that he would find surety/*certainty that it$N should be unkept through him or any that to him pertained, and$N this he has refused, the which I am bound to require my said$N lord the Prior and the convent of Durham that the said Prior$N of Coldingham his language nor writing are no hindering to me$N nor to my masters, while he and I appear in proper persons before$N the chapter and all the brethren that best know my government,$N the which appearance shall not be long to wit/*know my assent, with$N the grace of God. And on this Sunday in slandering of$N me he passed to Saint Ebbis, and gert/*caused his brother and the parish priest$N pace with him, and would let no mass be said nor service$N done to the parish within the church of Coldingham,$N and I was not content thereof and came to Coldingham the same$N Sunday, late at evening, and spoke somewhat with dean John$N Pencher for a pair of evidences that was in making between the$N said Prior and Sir Alexander of Hum of 15 year tack/*tenure of Alcombos;$N and I bade him say to the Prior and he fulfilled the evidence$N there should never be friendship between us, while I was living, for$N it is to me and my heritage and malign, as/*that I shall made$N known. And he sent the substance of his harness before him$N to Berwic, and thought to pass thither. And because of this$N language he hasted him the sooner, and passed on the night,$N foroute/*without leavetaking, and took all his brethren with him that was/*were$N in Coldingham. And where it was said to you that I purposed$N me to buy a tower in Aldcambos, and had laid stones on the$N ground, it is not so, for truly I nor my son was never purposed$N thereon, but they that made that language first, it was for$N furthering of themselves and hindering of me. Wherefore I$N require your lordship that you would with the bearer in haste$N write to the Prior of Coldingham that he made no secting$N of the said Aldcambos, while he and I compared$N before you in proper persons; so and he make any$N setting of the said place I shall summon him before the king or$N his justice or his sheriff, which pleases me best, and by the law of$N this land compel him to fulfil both the tack/*tenure and change of the$N said place that was delivered to him to be given to me and my$N son, and as we were accorded both before English and Scots$N that shall be witness thereto. And of all their matters, what time<p. 142$N that I and my son come to your lordship, we will be more$N ruled by you and your chapter than be any that lives, for we$N have ever been much behalden/*kept thereto. And of any discord that$N is between the Prior of Coldingham and his brother that there is$N and me I shall be full laght/*caught that it is hard ... ... while$N I come to your presence, so that he give nor take to Sir Alex of$N Aldcambos; and if he does, I require your lordship to hold$N me excused to make such present to me as before. Item I$N proferred the said Prior to hold his court and set his land at his$N own will and thereby have fealty of his tenants, and as yet I can not$N redo[?] him thereto, and whenever him list/*pleases there shall never be no$N fault in me.$N                                           s.d.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 26<Author(s)/writer(s): Thomas Bekynton (c. 1390-1465), ambassador in France<Place of author: Bordeaux<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (52)<Status of author: clergy and statesman<Recipient: King (Henry VI)<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: most high and mighty Prince<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: upwards<Exact date: 1442<Century (in quarters): 2/15<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Thomas Bekynton to King Henry VI (1442a),<Official Correspondence of T.

In Anglicis.$N         Most high and most mighty Prince$N         and our most doubted and dreaded$N         Sovereign Lord; After the most lowly$N         recommendation that we, your true humble$N subjects and servants, may or can in any manner$N unto your royal majesty do or devise, please it your$N said royal majesty to have in knowledge that we, your<p. 187$N said subjects and servants, with all our fellowship in$N good health of body, blessed be God, came and arrived$N to this your noble city of Bordeaux on Monday the$N 16. day of July, where at our first coming we$N found as sorrowful a town and as greatly dismayed and$N discouraged as any might be in the earth, as people$N desolate and cast out of all comfort of any security to be$N had from your said majesty against your enemies$N that have been in this country in great puissance; and$N after deliverance made unto them of the town of$N Tarteys have got by assault the town of Saint$N Severs; and also have won and subdued all the$N country of the land except Bayon and Aix. So that$N all that country was waxen/*grown almost rebel/*rebellious within 8$N days, as well barons as gentils/*gentry and others. And now$N your said enemies are before the said city of Aix,$N holding their siege there round about it in great$N multitude of men of arms; and another party of$N their puissance under the Lord Powns and other$N have laid siege to Sursak, which is but a day and a$N half journey from this your city of Bordeaux, as men$N say here. And as tidings are/*have come late from$N your town of Bayon your enemies purposen/*intend to make$N 4 bastilles/*towers about the said town of Aix and stuff$N therein with 3 or 4 thousand men of arms; and the$N remnant will depart and besiege your said town$N of Bayon; and so they enforce themselves in one time$N to get both towns, and so straight to come down$N hither and besiege this your town of Bordeaux.$N Your adversary of France and his son which calls$N himself dauphin, have been and are in proper person$N on the field in all this voyage. Not only these$N great enterprises and the mighty puissance of your$N said enemies caused the abashment of your true$N people of this your city of Bordeaux, but more without$N comparison the letters which were sent from your$N highness under your private seal and born hider<p. 188$N by one that calls himself Frauncois, whose name in$N deed Juon Goer, and delivered to diverse estates here$N the Sunday before our arrival, in the which Sunday$N the said Francois and others were set on land at$N Castellion, and from thence rode by land unto Bordeaux,$N before our coming, had reported and noised$N through the city that they should no succours/*help have;$N and, as them seemed, the letters meant the same:$N so that at our coming the city was full of rumour$N and of sorrow, and had no other trust, belief, nor$N concept, but that they were abandoned and cast$N away forever. But blessed be God which/*who, as we$N believe, verily in a good hour sent us hither for your$N well, Sovereign Lord, and of your country here, by$N our coming and arriving all your city was greatly$N recomforted, and in especial by the comfortable report$N of your succours to be had in haste, which to$N their greatest joy and gladness we showed and declared$N unto them, after the form of your gracious$N letters given under your signet of the eagle at your$N castle of Windsor the 24. day of June, and sent$N unto us at Plymouth; the which your letters we$N showed openly and read them before all your Counsel$N and other estates here the Tuesday next following;$N and after their desire we did/*caused them to be translated$N in to French and delivered them to the most$N Reverend Father in God the archbishop of this city,$N which/*who, the Wednesday next following, making right a$N good and a right stirring collection in his cathedral$N church read and declared the said letters so translated$N openly in the pulpit before all the people, rehearsing$N the good and tender zeal that you have to the conservation$N and the well/*welfare of this your city, and of all$N your true subjects in these parties, and putting$N them out of doubt of succours/*help to be had in right brief$N time; exciting them furthermore and exhorting by$N the faith and leégeance that they owe to your highness<p. 189$N to do all their pain, labour, and true diligence$N about the defence and safeguard/*safety of your city in$N the mean time; and so in truth they have done,$N and do daily in the best wise; and have fortified the$N said city with bulwarks, guns, engines, and all other$N necessary habiliments in the strongest wise; and also$N scoured/*cleaned and pared/*trimmed the ditches, and made their town$N in all parts so ready and so mighty that in our concept$N they are great and notably thankworthy. And$N for sooth, Sovereign Lord, we have not ceased/*stopped nor$N cease daily to give them comfort and courage, offering$N ourselves and our poor company to be ready at$N all times to help them and strengthen them in as$N much as in us is, for the defense and saving of the$N city, abiding here with them still: for as yet we$N can not conceive that we shall move, hanging/*depending on this$N war will pass any further, after the nature and$N quality of our message. Wherefore, most gracious$N and most Christian Prince, we beseech your high and$N noble grace that you will open your eyes of pity$N and compassion upon your true subjects here, which$N as now live in great dread, and without that help$N be/*were had/*received the rather are like to perish; and that$N you will also call unto your consideration how this$N your Duchy of Guienne is one of the oldest lordships$N longing to your crown of England; and thereupon$N of your most merciful and pitious grace, command$N and do such diligence be had that your succours be$N sent in hasty time after the form of your said$N letters, so that by negligence or delays it come not$N too late, and inconvenience irrecuperable be/*is grown in the$N meantime, which God defend; in such wise also$N that we are found no gabbers/*liars in executing your commandment$N and declaring your letters. Also, Sovereign$N Lord, in taking of Saint Severs, Sir Thomas$N Rempston your seneschal is taken prisoner and, as it$N is said, the seal which he had and occupied under my<p. 190$N Lord of Huntingdon is taken also, whereof we advise$N your highness to the intent that if your enemies$N will forge or contrive any writing under the said seal$N no credence be given thereunto. Master John de$N Batute departed hence on Saturday at noon towards$N his country. Furthermore, Sovereign Lord, before the$N closing of these, tidings of truth have been sent hider that$N the town of Sursak, belonging to the Baron of Gomonde,$N upon the river of Durdon, is taken by a party of$N your adversary's puissance, which is under the governance$N of the Lord Powns and other; and they now$N have laid siege to the town of Bellinder upon the$N same river, belonging to the Archbishop of Bordeaux,$N which comes now to your highness; and so they$N purpose to subdue all the fortresses in that party of$N the said river, and pass into your country of Deuxmars$N and to win it, the siege being at Bordeaux;$N for as for the countries of Xantonge and of Madok$N they make no doubt with one over riding soon to$N get it. Most high and most mighty Prince and$N our most doubted Sovereign Lord, we beseech our$N blessed Trinity ever to have you in His gracious$N keeping and governance, and to send you as great$N prosperity as ever had earthly Prince, and send you$N victory of all your enemies.

And since then he has of new increased his$N army, and after that sieged and taken your town$N and castle of Mavesyn, and upon that the 3. day of$N this present month he laid siege to your town and$N castle of Rieul, which is but 7 leagues from this$N your city of Bordeaux, the which town he got with an assault$N the 8. day of this same month, and slew therein$N many people. Nevertheless the castle holds as yet,$N and within it for lack of other help there have been of our$N fellowship all such as we might spare: God send them$N comfort and more help by time. After this he purposes,$N as me seems, to besiege the towns of Saint$N Makery, Cadiliac, and Rious; and he holds him$N sure to get them all by assault in right brief time,$N and then all is French, and by the said river unto$N the gates of this your city. Also please it your royal Majesty$N furthermore to know that after that your said$N city of Aix and your town of Saint Sever were now$N late reduct/*reduced to your obeisance, as we suppose you have$N well had in knowledge by such passages as have come$N from your town of Bayon, for as from hence sithen the$N departing of the archbishop of Bordeaux went never$N passage; nor unto this time was no manner of navir/*shipping$N for to pass in. Your said adversary has commanded$N the Earl of Fux to lay new siege to your$N said town and city of Saint Sever and Aix. The which<p. 214$N Earl, as is done us to understand by letters sent hither$N for succours from the said town of Saint Sever, has$N disposed it to besiege it; and as we trust he has$N laid the siege before this. And here may be had no$N comfort of succours to help them with, for we have$N nothing wherewith to help ourselves, the which causes$N great heaviness, desolation, and sorrow amongst all your$N people here, seeing that after promise of succours declared$N unto them by your commandment has passed$N so long a time and no comfort comes, not so$N much in all this time as one balinger/*small ship to revive their$N hearts, and put them in good trust and hope of$N comfort. Truly in concept of your true men here a$N little number of good men sent hither by time as it$N was promised might have kept your country from$N this great hurt; which 20 thousand pounds will not now by many$N days lightly recover; and yet furthermore, if your$N merchants had been suffered to pass hither for the$N vintage in such time as they have been accustomed$N in years before, doubtless your enemies would not have$N abidden to do this great harm that they have done and$N daily do. God send us hasty tidings for comfort of$N your people here, which in truth, as in our opinion,$N stood never so dismayed before this time. By these$N tidings, most gracious sovereign lord, you may clearly$N understand how the ways of our message have been impeached/*hindered$N and forbarred/*barricaded; and as Master John de Batute$N has written to us, your said adversary by no manner$N of mean/*lament may be induced to grant us his letters$N of safe conduct; and so it is not seen to us possible$N as yet in any manner of wise to pass upward in$N surete/*security of our persons. Wherefore please it your high$N and noble grace to let us have knowledge of your$N gracious pleasure on this behalf, and how you want we$N shall be furthermore governed and demeaned. Over$N this at the request of your counsel here and for our$N true acquittal we advise as we dare your Highness,<p. 215$N for the well/*welfare of you and of this your country here, not$N lightly to pass upon such grants of your demesnes/*possessions$N or of other lands, rents, or revenues here, as peradventure$N shall be asked of your said Highness, but that it$N please your Majesty to abide (by) the advise of your said$N counsel, which purpose/*intend by commune and moor deliberation$N to ascertain your said Majesty of such inconveniences$N as by such grants have grown here before,$N and in what wise they may for your well/*welfare be eschewed$N hereafter. Most blessed Sovereign Lord, we have right$N now received letters from the Lord de Gramond, written$N at Aix the 9th day of this month, declaring that the$N said town of Saint Sever has appointed with the said$N Earl to be French unless than they will be rescued within$N a month. Please it furthermore your Highness to$N know that Sir Robert Clyfton, Knight, late your constable$N of your castle of Bordeaux, is to God passed the 3.$N day of this month; so it is right expedient for your$N well/*wellfare in hasty time to purvey an other sufficient$N officer in that behalf. Most Christian, etc. Written$N at Bordeaux, the 18. day of October.$N                                      Roos R.$N                                      T.

After due and$N humble recommendation please it your noble lordship to$N have a knowledge that amongst all other things that$N have been shown and opened unto me since my$N coming in to my cure here to be reformed and corrected,$N on the greatest and most grievous of open disobedience$N and rebellion against God and the jurisdiction$N of the Church has been made unto me with great cry$N and sorrowful complaint against certain tenants of yours$N at Shirborne and others inhabiting your town of Langport,$N which as men lawless, neither dreading God nor$N living after the laws of holy Church, without any$N priest or clerk presume to do sacraments of the church,$N as in burying the dead, and will not suffer their curate$N which under God and me has cure of their souls, to$N do divine service nor to minister unto them any of$N the sacraments of the Church, nor none of my ministers$N or officers to do any correction of their trespasses in$N salvation of their souls.

Truly, my lord, any$N true Christian prince may well understand that where$N as true obeisance is suffered to be withdrawn from$N God and his church, it must soon after, by God's$N rightful doom and punishment, be withdrawn from$N man that suffers and helps it to be done.

And as touching the$N said 40 shillings with 40 shillings more that the said John Mayor paid to Trevylian,$N he was paid again by the fellowship of the collect money to the$N plea, etc. How the said Richard Druell and William Speere$N speeded when they came to London it appears in a schedule by the$N said Richard Druell and William Speer thereof made, remaining$N with the said Rychard Druell. Furthermore as touching the going$N of the said John Shillingford, mayor, he was all ready for to ride$N the said Monday: LAT_varians I moved between him and the said$N Richard Druell, nevertheless better accord had by means of Thomas$N Cook, Richard Druell with others held his way, and the said$N mayor abode at home in to a Tuesday next after Saint Luke's day$N for setting of the King's dime, coming of Trevylian, and other$N great matters touching the city, and in especial to have the fellowship$N together, a sad communication to be had or his departing, the$N which communication might not be had before Saturday next after$N Saint Luke's day for this cause that the great part of the fellowship$N was at Calston's fair, and those that were at home, as Upton, Coteler$N and Pope, were sick on their beds; and for all these causes$N the mayor abode at home so long, and all that time he kept his$N 3 horses in (the) stable every day ready to ride to him great coste. The$N Tuesday he rode and with him William Hampton and John Fagot.$N On Wednesday at night they came to Shaftesbury and there met$N with Richard Druell, which made report of his good speed and great$N labour at London, as it appears in his said remembrance, and$N that on the best wise. The Saturday next thereafter the mayor<p. 6$N came to Westminster soon upon 9 at the bell, and there met with$N my lord Chanceller at the broad door a little from the stair foot$N coming from the Steer/Control chamber, I in the court and by the door$N kneeling and saluting him in the most goodly wise that I could$N and recommended in to his God and gracious lordship my fellowship$N and all the communalty, his own people and beadsmen of the City of$N Exeter. He said to the mayor 2 times "Welcome," and the$N 3rd time "Right welcome Mayor" and held the mayor a great$N while fast/*firm by the hand, and so went forth to his barge and with him$N great press/*crowd, lords and others, etc. and in especial the tresurer of$N the King's household, with whom he was at right great private communication.$N And therefore I, mayor, drew me apart, and met with$N him at his going in to his barge, and there took my leave of him,$N saying these words, "My lord, I will await upon your good$N lordship and your better leisure at another time." He said to me$N again, "Mayor, I pray you heartily that you do so, and that you speak$N with the Chief Justice and what time that ever he will I will be all$N ready." And thus departed, etc. The Sunday about 8 at the$N clock I came to Lambeth, and with me Dowrissh and Speere to meet$N and speak with my said lord. We met and spoke with him in the$N inner chamber, he at that time being right busy going in to his$N closet. And with right good language and good cheer in goodly wise$N excused him that he might not speak with us at that time for$N great business, and commanded us to come again tomorrow. I,$N mayor, prayed him of one a word at that time and no more, I saying$N that I was informed that he was displeased of my late coming, and$N if he so were, I besought him to hire my excuse great. He$N said, "No;" but that I was/*had come in right good time and well$N come, and at his departing in to his closet he said, "Mayor, would$N God you had made a good end at home." And I said, "Would$N God my lord that we so had, and God I take to record I have$N done my due diligent part thereto, and that in time I trust to God$N you shall well know; for I have right many things to inform you<p. 7$N of if I had time." He said, "Well, mayor," and bade me come$N again that same day afternoon, and so departed, etc. I was by the$N Styward and many other of the household full fair I bade to abide$N at meat/*meal, nor never had better cheer of my lord nor of the household$N then I had at the time. Nevertheless I excused me and would$N not abide as for time. And so went over the water to Temple to$N Bluet, etc. and so went with Bluet, Dowrissh, Speere and I to the$N chief justice and commoned/*communicated of many things with him. He is likely as$N I conceive to have the great rule in this matter, for my lord Chancellor$N said, as it is above said, that he would attend when the$N justice would, the which I said to the justice. The justice$N said he would be ready at his calling. And as I conceive by$N diverse words that they have commoned/*communicated of a rule in this matter;$N what ever it is I can not know as yet. God have grace it is$N good, and so I trust to God that it be. That afternoon I went$N again to Lambeth to my lord after his commandment abovesaid and$N when I came thither to him in his inner chamber, there was$N much people, lords and others, my lord Treasurer, under-treasurer,$N the privy seal, land dyvours/*bankrupts, abbots and priors, and many strangers$N alien of other lands. And then came in the Duke of Bokingham,$N and there was great business at that time, hardly all men were bid$N to avoid that chamber safe/*except the lords. Nevertheless I awaited my$N time and put me in press/*crowd and went right to my lord Chancellor$N and said, "My lord I am/*have come at your commandment, but I$N see your great business is such that you may not attend." He$N said, "No, by his truth, and that I might right well see." I said$N "Yee", and that I was sorry and had pity of his great vexation."$N He said "Mayor, I must tomorrow ride by time/*early to the King, and$N come again this week: you must await upon my coming, and then I$N will speak with the justice and attend for you, etc," I said, "My$N lord, I will do after your commandment," and prayed him of his$N good and gracious lordship of no word more, if he were informed<p. 8$N by word or by writing of anything that I have done or said or$N governed me in any wise at home since the last term my departing$N from him otherwise than to his pleasure and after his commandment.$N He said right heartily "No," but that I had$N governed me at home in the most best and goodly wise and therefore$N he owed me great thank, and said heartily that I should have$N God's blessing and his therefore, etc. And so departed, etc.$N   Nota that Druell and Speere's being afore/*going ahead did good, for they$N did their part in the most best wise.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 34<Author(s)/writer(s): John Shillingford<Place of author: x<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: x<Status of author: bourgeois (mayor of Exeter)<Recipient: Deputy?<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: other<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1447<Century (in quarters): 2/15<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<John Shillingford to his deputy (1447),<Letters and Papers of John Shillingford, ed.

He told Dorlet$N that he had such a deed as he supposed that would do ease in$N proving of the title that the Duke of Suffolk claims in Drayton.$N For the same deed that he sent me, the seal of arms is like$N unto the copy that I send you, and no_thing like to the Duke of$N Suffolk's ancestors....$N     Item, John Russe sent me word that Barker and Harry Porter$N told him in council that the Duke of Suffolk has bought one$N Brytyeff right, the which makes a claim unto Heylysdon;$N and the said Duke is proposed to enter within short time after$N Easter; for in so much the said Russe felt by the said Barker$N and Porter that all the feoffees will make a release unto the Duke,$N and help him that they can into their power, for to have his good$N lordship....$N    Item, I understand by John Pampyng that you will not that your$N son be taken into your house, nor helped by you, till such time$N of year as he was put out thereof, the which shall be about$N Saint Thomas Mess. For God's sake, Sir, have pity on him, and$N remember you it has been a long season since he had out of you$N to help him with, and he has obeyed him to you, and will$N do at all times, and will do that he can or may to have your$N good fatherhood. And at the reverence of God, be you his good$N father and have a fatherly heart to him; and I hope he shall ever$N know him_self the better herafter, and be the more aware to$N eschew such things as should displease you, and for to take$N heed at that should please you.$N    Pecock shall tell you by mouth of more things than I may$N write to you at this time.

And Pyrs Waryn, otherwise called Pyrs at$N Sloth, which is a flickering fellow and a busy with Master$N Philip and the bailiff of Cosshay, he had a plough going in your$N land in Drayton; and there your said servants at that time$N took his plough ware, that is to say 2 mares, and brought them to$N Haylysdon, and there they are yet/*still. And on the next morning$N after, Master Philip and the bailiff of Cosshay came to Haylys_don$N with a great number of people, that is to say 8 men and$N more in harness, and there took from the parson's plough 2 horse,$N price 4 mark, and 2 horse of Thomas Stermyn's plough, price 40 shillings,$N saying to himself that there was taken a plaint against them in the$N hundred by the said Pyrs for taking off the foresaid ploughware at$N Drayton, and but they would be bound to come of Drayton on$N Tuesday next coming to answer to such matters as shall be$N said to them there, they should not have their beasts again; which$N they refused to do unto the time that they had an awnswer$N from you; and so they led the beasts forth to Drayton, and from$N Drayton forth to Cosshay.$N    And the same afternoon following, the parson of Haylesdon sent$N his man to Drayton with Stermyn for to speak with Master$N Philipp, to know a way if they should have again their cattle or$N not; and Master Philip answered them, if that they would$N bring home their distress again that was taken of Pyrs Waryn,<p. 43$N that then he would deliver them theirs, or else not. And he let them$N plainly *know that if you or any of your servants took any$N distress in Drayton, that were but the value of a hen, they would$N come to Haylesdon and take there the value of an ox therefore,$N and if they cannot take the value thereof there, that then they$N will do break your tenant's houses in Haylesdon, and take as$N much as they could find therein; and if they be letted thereof--$N which shall never lie in your power for to do, for the Duke of$N Suffolk is able to keep daily in his house more men then$N Dabeney had heres/*armies in his head if him liked ('and as for Dabe_ney,$N he is a lewd fellow, and so he shall be served hereafter, and$N I would that he were here') - and therefore, he said, if you take$N upon you to let them so for to do, that then they would go$N into any life(hood) that you had in Norfolk or Suffolk and to take a$N distress in like wise as they would do at Haylysdon; and other$N answer could they none get, and so they departed....$N    Item, I pray you send hastily word how that you will that we$N be guided with this place, for as it is told me it is like to stand$N in as great jeopardy in haste as others (have) done. On Thursday all day$N there were kept in Drayton lodge into 60 persons, and yet, as it is$N told me, there be within daily and nightly into a 16 or 20$N persons.$N    Item, it is told me that Thomas Elys of Norwych, which$N now is chosen mayor, said at Drayton that if my Lord of$N Suffolk need a 100 men he would purvey him thereof, and if any$N men of the town would go to Paston he would do lay them fast in$N prison....$N    Item, I have left John Paston the older at Caster to keep the place$N there, as Richard can tell you; for I had lief/*prefer, and it pleased$N you, to be captainess here than at Caster. Yet I was nothing purposed$N to abide here when [I] come from home but for a day or two;$N but I shall abide here till I hear tidings from you....$N    Item, my mother told me that she thinks right strange that$N she may not have the profits of Clyre his place in peaceable$N wise for you. She said it is hers and she has paid most ther_fore$N yet, and she says she will have the profits thereof, or else$N she will make more folk to speak thereof. She says she knew$N not what right nor title that you have therein but if you like to<p. 44$N trouble with her, and that should be no worship to you; and she$N says she will be there this summer and repair the housing there.$N In good faith I hear much language of the demeaning between you$N and her. I would right fain, and so would many more of your$N friends, that it were otherwise between you than it is; and if it$N were I hope you should have the better speed in all other matters.$N    I pray God be your good speed in all your matters, and if$N you grace to have a good conclusion of them in haste; for this is$N too worried a life to abide for you and all yours. Written in haste$N at Haylysdon the 10 day of May. The cause that I send to you this$N hastily is to have an answer in haste from you.$N                                    Yours, M.

The Duke of$N Suffolk's men threaten daily Dawbeney, Wykys, and Richard$N Calle that wheresoever they may get them they should die, and$N affrays have ben made on Rychard Calle this week so that he was$N in great jeopardy at Norwich among them. And great affrays$N have been made upon me and my fellowship here on Monday last$N past, of which Richard Calle tells me that he has sent you$N word of in writing more plainly/*fully that/*than I may do at this time,$N but I shall inform you more *fully hereafter.$N   I suppose there shall be great labour against you and your servants$N at the assises/*sittings and sessions here, wherefore me seems,$N saving your better advice, it were well done that you should speak,$N with the justices or they come here; and if you will that I complain$N to them or to any other, if good fortune (*gives) me life and health,$N I will do as you advise me to do, for in good faith I have been$N simply entreated among them. And what with sickness and$N trouble that I have had, I am brought right low and weak; but to$N my power I will do as I can or may in your matters.<p. 48$N    The Duke of Suffolk and both the Duchesses shall come to$N Claxton this day, as I am informed, and this next week he shall$N be at Cossey. Whether he will come further hitherward or not$N I *know not yet. It is said that he should come hither, and yet his$N men said here on Monday that he claimed no title to this place.$N They said their coming was but to take out such riotous people$N as was here within this place, and such as were the King's$N felonies and indited and outlawed men; nevertheless they would$N show no warrants whereby to take none such, though there had been$N such here. I suppose if they might have come in peaceably they$N would have made another cause of their coming.$N    When all was done and they should depart, Harlyston and$N other desired me that I should come and see my old lady, and$N show to my lord, and if anything were amiss it should be$N amended. I said if I should (*pur)sue for any remedy that I should$N sue further, and let the King and all the lords of this land$N to have knowledge what has been done to us, if so were that the$N Duke would maintain that has been done to us by his servants,$N if you would give me leave. I pray you send me word if you will$N that I make any complaint to the Duke or the Duchesse; for as$N it is told me, they know not the *fullness that has been done in$N such things as has been done in their names.$N I should write much more to you but for lack of leisure....$N The Trinity have you in keeping.

I$N was at Haylesdon upon Thursday last past and saw the place$N there, and in good faith there will no creature think how foul$N and horribly it is arrayed but if they saw it. There comes much$N people daily to wonder thereupon, both of Norwich and of$N other places, and they speak shamefully thereof. The Duke had been$N better than a 1000 pounds that it had never been done, and you have the more$N good will of the people that it is so foul done. And they made/*forced$N your tenants of Haylesdon and Drayton with others, to help$N to break down the walls of the place and the log both, God$N knows full evil against their wills, but that they durst no$N other conscience do for fear. I have spoken with your tenants$N of Haylesdon and Drayton both, and put them in comfort as$N well as I can.$N    The Duke his men ransacked the church and bore away all the$N good that was left there, both of ours and of the tenants, and$N left not so much but that they stood upon the high altar and$N ransacked the images, and took away such as they might find,$N and put away the parson out of the church till they had done,$N and ransacked every man's house in the town five or six times. And$N the chief masters of robbing was the bailiff of Ey, the bailiff$N of Stradbroke, Thomas Slyford; and Slyford was the chief robber$N of the church, and he has most of the robbery next the$N bailiff of Ey. And as for lead, brass, pewter, iron, doors, gates,$N and other stuff of the house, men of Coshay and Causton have$N it, and that/*what they might/*could not carry they have hewn it asunder in$N the most *despicable wise. If it might be, I would some men of$N worship might be sent from the King to see how it is, both$N there and at the log, ere than any snows come, that they may$N make report of the truth; else it shall no more be seen so plainly/*fully$N as it may now.$N   And at the reverence of God, speed your matters now, for it<p. 57$N is too horrible a cost and trouble that we have now daily, and must$N have till it be other_wise; and your men dare not go about$N to gather upon your livelihood, and we keep here daily more than$N 30 persons for salvation of us and the place, for in very$N truth and the place had not been kept strong the Duke had$N come hither.$N     The mayor of Norwich did arrest the bailiff of Normandies,$N Lovegold, Gregory Cordonere, and Bartholomew Fuller without$N any authority save only he says that he has a commandment$N of the Duke to do so; and he will not let them out of$N prison till he had surete/*safety for each of them in 4 pounds for to awnswer$N to such matters as the Duke and his council will put against them$N at any time that they be called, and so will he do to others, as$N many as he may get, that owe you any good will. And also the$N Mayor would have had them sworn that they should never be$N against the Duke nor none of his, which they would not do in no$N wise....$N     At the reverence of God, if any worshipful and profitable means$N may be taken in your matters, forsake it not in eschewing of our$N trouble not great costs and charges that we have and may grow$N hereafter. It is thought here that if my Lord of Norfolk would$N take upon him for you, and that he may have a commission for$N to enquire of such riots and robberies as has been done to you$N and others in this country, that then all the country will await$N upon him and serve your intent, for the people loves and$N dreads him more then any other lord except the King and my$N Lord of Warwyk, etc....$N     And I pray you heartily send me word how you do and how you$N speed in your matters in haste, and that I may have knowledge$N how your sons does. I come home this night late, and shall be$N here till I hear other tidings from you. Wykys came home$N upon Saturday, but he met not with your sons.

And after my coming to the court I made due$N scrutiny of the state of your cause; where I found the$N register given to the judge and the cause put into the ?rot/*file, and the$N sentence thrice written. At the last it was espied/*wathed we had not$N sufficiently proved our ?spectacle; wherefore the judge nor the ?rot/*file$N would suffer no sentence pass without we would prove our$N people by them that were present and see it. Wherefore we were$N out of all remedy but one, and that was to have had a remission/*pardon$N to certain judges, and to have brought up 2 or 3 of our$N brothers that were present when the Prior and they were put out$N by violence. This would have been grievous costly and tedious;$N for one way and other you should not have shaped with 100 pound;$N but, thanked be God, suddenly, according to truth and conscience$N and right, we found 2 men that has testified the same,$N and laid the remission, fatigation, and grievous costs apart.<p. 216$N And within short days we trustfully, by God's grace, to have$N a sentence; the which shall be to you and the Monastery the$N greatest worship that ever you had in your days.

Gairdner, pp. 231-238.$N To the King's Most Noble Grace.$N   About the last day of September last past, being in$N a secret counter within your deputy his place at Calais,$N he, Sir Hugh Conway, your treasurer there, and Sir$N Sampson Norton, master porter of that your said$N town, clad to them my brother William Nanfan and$N me. Then said my master your deputy to us, "Sirs,$N we must common/*communicate here now of many great matters$N touching the King's grace and the surety/*safety of this his$N town of Calais. Therefore because you are next unto$N me, I must sometime put you in trust more than others.$N You shall hear here these matters that we intend to$N common/*communicate of; but first you shall be both sworn upon$N a book that you shall never utter nothing that is now$N here spoken, without it be to the King's grace if need$N shall require, or else to non living creature." Then$N after many matters spoken by my master your deputy$N and reasoned to the same by your treasurer and porter,$N which matters and whereof they were, I am and shall be$N ready to show to your Highness at such time or times$N that best shall please your grace that I so do.$N   Then said Sir Hugh Conway, "Master deputy, if$N you knew as much as I do, you would say that you had$N as great cause to take keep/*care to yourself as any living$N creature; and thereto you are as much bound to thank$N God for that you have escaped hitherto as you have, for$N I know those persons that have been set to murder you,$N and by whose cause and means they so did." My$N master asked him what they were he would then show$N him, but said that he would show him more of that$N matter at another time when we shall have more$N leisure. So for what he said now am I and master$N porter as far into the dance as you are, for I promise$N you of my faith that all those that are and were$N proffered hither into their rooms by my Lord Chamberlain$N shall never love none of us, and especially those that$N were his household servants before. The cause why$N they so do I cannot tell, but for that we follow the$N King's pleasure and so will do. Therefore good it is that$N we see to our own surety, as well as for the surety$N of this the King's town, that it may be sure to him$N and his, what world so ever shall happen to fall here$N after, to have in remembrance that the greater and$N more part of those that are in the King's retinue here$N are of my Lord's preferment. Also look how strong$N he is in the King's court of his household servants,$N for the more part of his guard are of those that were$N my Lord Chamberlain's servants before. And hard it$N is to know men's minds if God should send a$N sudden change, as he has here before.$N   Then said my master, your deputy, that "I dare$N receive the sacrament that my Lord is as true to the$N King's grace as any man living," and in like wise<p. 232$N said master porter.$N   Item, my master your deputy, said, "My Lord Chamberlain$N was very slack in one journey, wherewith I$N know well that the King's grace was discontent; for and$N he had done his part well, the Cornish men had$N never made the King fell at Blake heath, but had all$N been destroyed long before their coming thither, that I$N know well the King's grace had liefer/*rather had be done$N than 20 thousand for his honour.$N   Item, after many words spoken, Sir Hugh Conway$N said, "Masters, I have not spoken these words for no$N untruth that I do think by now in my Lord Chamberlain,<p. 233$N for I dare say now as you do that he loves$N the King as well as any man can do living; but it$N has been seen in times past that change of worlds$N has caused change of mind."$N   Item, the same Sir Hughe said, that "we be here,$N now together the King's true servants to live and die,$N and also to spend all that we have in the world to$N do his grace service. Therefore what_so_ever we speak$N or common/*communicate for his surety, and for the surety of this his$N town, can be no treason; so good it is that we look$N and speak of things to come as well as those present.$N I do speak this for a cause that is good that we look$N sadly to, for the King's grace is but a weak man and$N sickly, not likely to be no long life’s man. It is not$N long since his Highness was sick and lay then in his$N manner in Wangsted. It happened the same time me$N to be among many great personages, the which feel$N in communication of the King's grace and of the world$N that should be after him if his grace happened to depart."$N Then he said that some of them spoke of my Lord of$N Buckingham, saying that he was a noble man and$N would be a real ruler. Other there were that spoke, he$N said, in likewise of your traitor Edmond De la Pole,$N but none of them, he said, that spoke of my Lord$N prince. Then said master porter to him, "Have you$N never broken to the King's grace of this matter?"$N Then said Sir Hughe Conway to him again, "I pray$N you suffer me to tell forth my tale, for I am not$N yet at_the end. You have in mind what that I have$N showed you touching this/*these matters. Of my faith, in like$N wise since my coming I have showed the same to$N Sir Nicholas Voux, lieutenant of Gysnes, and to Sir$N Anthony Brown, lieutenant of the castle here, and$N they answered me both this, that they had two good$N holds to resort unto, the which they said should be$N sure to make their pace, how so ever the world turns."$N Then my master your deputy, and master porter,<p. 234$N both said to him that he could no let do but show$N these matters unto your Highness. He said that, "It$N were good that the King’s grace knew these sayings,$N but as yet I have not showed him no part hereof,$N neither never I will do." Then said master porter to$N him angrily, and swore by God's precious soul he$N be the more to blame to keep such matters from his$N Highness; and in like wise said my master your$N deputy, and all we being there.$N   Item, after many words spoken touching the$N same, Sir Hughe Conway said, "If you knew King$N Harry our master as I do, you would be aware how that$N you broke to him in only such matters, for he would$N take it to be said but of envy, ill will and malice.$N Then should any_one have blame and no thank for his$N truth and good mind; and that have I well proved$N here_to_fore in like causes, for that time that the$N Lord Lovell lay in Colchester a trusty friend of mine$N came to me and showed me in council the day and$N time of his departing, and of all his purpose. I was$N sworn to him that I should never utter this to man$N living to his hurt/*harm; but yet forthwith afterwards,$N be_cause of my allegiance, I came to Sir Raynold Bray$N and showed him all as is above, and forthwith he said$N that Master Bray showed the same unto the King’s.$N Whereupon I was brought before his Highness and I$N affirmed all to be true as my said friend had showed;$N and the King said that it could not be so, and$N reasoned with me always to the contrary of my said$N sayings. At last he asked what he was that told me$N thus tale of his departing. I prayed his Highness to$N pardon me, for I said that I was sworn to him that I$N should never utter him, to be drawn with wild$N horses; wherewith the King was angry and displeased<p. 235$N with me for my good will. I shall no more tempt him$N while I live in such causes." Then said master porter,$N "I think that you dare never speak these words to$N the King’s grace as you have rehearsed them now here,"$N and he swore my great oath that he did.$N  Item, my master your deputy said that "I know well$N that the King’s Highness is hard of credence/*belief in such$N matters; and that know you," he said, "master porter,$N as well as I, for how long was it ere/*before his grace and$N his council would believe one thing of untruth to be$N in Sir James Tyrell; and some said I did seek to do$N him hurt for malice."$N   "Item, another time I did write unto his Highness$N that one had showed me that Sir Robert Clyfford$N should say here in his town to a lady that Perken$N Warbeke was King Edward’s son. Never words$N went colder to my heart then they did. His Highness$N sent me sharp writing again that he would have the$N proof of this matter. I had no witness then, but my$N self; but as it happened afterwards I caused him by$N good craft to confess the same he had said to me$N be_fore him that was marshall here at that time, and$N else I had likely to be put to a great plunge for my$N truth. At the last all thought that it was not to$N show this to your grace without better proof; yet$N master porter said it was great pity that the King$N did not trust his true knights better, and to give$N them credence/*belief in such things as they should show$N for his surety, for great hurt/*harm may come by that man."$N   Item, after this the treasurer said, "Master deputy and$N master porter, what danger are we in now, remembering$N all things well, for we have no such holds,$N to resort unto as these other men have, considering$N also our many enemies that we have in this town and<p. 236$N else_where that will be glad to destroy and murder us all$N if other should come to the King’s grace than weal.$N And for truth I know well that he cannot long continue$N for it is written of him that he shall no longer$N reign than did King Edward, which", he said, "was$N but 22nd year and little more." Then said my master$N your deputy, "I be_shrew/*condemn his heart that so did$N write, and also I pray God send all them that think$N the same to be true a short shameful death." The$N treasurer said again, "We may not be angry in this$N matters when we shall common for the surety of our$N selves as well as of this the King’s town, for I think$N not verily thus to be all true that I have said, but I$N know well that every man is mortal and must die, and$N that that I have said I shall show you my book that$N shall declare you the same plainly to be as I have said$N and spoken." Master porter said, "Then I pray you,$N master treasurer, bring that book, and a vengeance take$N the first writer."$N   Item, then said my master your deputy to master$N Convay, "I pray you leave this prophecy of the$N King, for you speak of things that I never keep$N never hear nor see, and that my prayer is that I never$N leave day another hour longer than the King’s grace$N and his children shall have and enjoy the realm of$N England." And likewise spoke master porter and we$N all being there.$N   Item, then said master Conway, "All this that I$N have spoken is to the intent to have all things to be$N made sure for the King and his children, and especially$N this his town of Calais; and that can never be done$N without good and wise communication had of the same$N before; for I tell you for surety that that shall never$N be as long as the lady Luse shall be in the castle, that$N we can assure the King of this his town, for the$N castle is the key of this town; he that is therein$N being of a contrary mind may let men enough in<p. 237$N one night to destroy us all while we shall be in our$N beds sleeping. I know, masters," he said, "what$N longs to such matters better than you do; therefore$N I pray you suffer me for to speak. Let not us$N think the contrary but and the King’s were once$N departed, she being in the castle here and Edmond$N De la Pole her cousin at his liberty, but that$N she would help him in his causes with all her$N power and to let him come into this town by the$N postern/*backdoor of the castle to the destruction of us$N all. Remember well how near that Kent is hither, what$N alliance they be/*are of there." He spoke of Sir Edward Poy_nynges,$N Sir Richard Gylforth, Sir Thomas Bouchir.$N What he said of her demeanour, master porter, if your$N grace examine him can show your Highness better$N than I can do. Also he said, "Remember all the$N company of this the King's return here, what ill mind$N they bear unto us that will be all ready then to follow$N higher mind as they do now, and to do us the most$N mischief they can do," and named Richard Wod_house$N and John Clynton spiers/*spies. Item, Raynold of$N the Chambre, a constable of the retinue, with other.$N "These men," he said, "never loved the King’s$N grace, nor never would do, with many more of the same$N mind within this town. Now I have showed all$N the worst. This be a shrewd/*damned company set in ill$N mind. Doubt you not but this will fail indeed$N but good provision be made for the remedy in time."$N   Item, then said my master your deputy, "If such$N thing shall happen, as I pray God that I never$N live to see, the King’s grace to depart before me,$N but and it please God that he shall so do, to be for$N the surety and use of my Lord prince and for all my$N master's children to have this town all times at their$N own will and rule; and rather than it should be$N otherwise I had liefer/*rather suffer death. And we do$N wisely, I doubt not but by good counsel we shall be able<p. 238$N by good police to destroy all the captains and ringleaders$N that be of ill and contrary mind; that done,$N the other will be good to rule. So I trust that we$N shall always keep the town and marches to the$N King’s use and his." More of this touching this$N last article was spoken, which is not now perfectly$N in my remembrance; but well I remember that every man$N named one to rid the world of, if such$N danger should come to pass, as I trust never to see$N by God’s grace, who ever preserve your Highness.$N   Item, by the faith that I bear unto my Saviour$N Christ Jesus and to your Highness, this before rehearsed$N was the saying of every of them as near as I can$N call now to my remembrance.<{2_pages_left_out}$N                        Your most lowly subject and servant,$N                                  JOHN FLAMANK.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 108<Author(s)/writer(s): Agnes Plumpton (c1455-1504)<Place of author: Plumpton, Yorkshire<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: 40+ (c48)<Status of author: gentry<Recipient: Robert Plumpton<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Sir<Relation of correspondents: wife to husband<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1503<Century (in quarters): 1/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<Agnes Plumpton to Sir Robert Plumpton (1503),<Plumpton Correspondence, ed.

Sir, I beseech$N you to remember your great cost and charges, and mine, and$N labour the matter that it might have an end, for they have taken$N on capias and delivered for certain of your tenants. And so they$N have taken Edmund Ward at Knarsbrough and arrest him; the$N which is a great nossen in the country, that they shall get such$N process, and you do none to them, but let them have their$N mind fulfilled in every case.

The$N victory has been so great that I think none such$N has been seen before.

Almoner, for the pain you take$N remembering to write to me so often, I thank you for it$N with all my heart, praying you to continue still sending$N me word how the King does, and if he keep still his$N good rule as he began. I think with the company$N of the_emperor and with his good counsel his Grace shall<p. 85$N not adventure himself so much as I was afraid of$N before. I was very glad to hear the meeting of$N them both, which has been to my seeming the$N greatest honour to the King that ever came to Prince.$N The_emperor has done every thing like himself. I$N trust to God he shall_be thereby known for one of$N the_excellentest princes in the world, and taken for a(_)nother$N man than he was before thought. M. Almoner$N I think myself that I am so bound to him for my$N part, that, in my letter, I beseech the King to rerommend me$N unto him, and if his Grace thinks that this shall_be$N well done I pray you to remember it. News from_hence$N I have none; but such as I [am] sure the counsel$N have advertised the King of, and thereby you shall$N see how Almighty God helps here our part as_wel as$N there. I trow_(trust) the cause is (a[s I hear say) that$N the King disposes himself to him so well that I hope$N all . . shall_be the better for his merits. And with this I$N make an ende.

My husband, for hastiness,$N with Rogecrosse I could not send your Grace$N the piece of the King of Scot’s coat which John Glyn$N now brings. In this your grace shall see how I can$N keep my promise, sending you for your banners a King’s$N coat. I thought to send himself unto you, but our$N Englishmen’s hearts would not suffer it.    It should have$N been better for him to have been in peace than have$N this reward.

This matter is so$N marvellous that it seems to be of God’s doing alone.

I did after his commandment, and showed$N the same before Sir Thomas Lovell and Mr Englefeld$N unto my Lord of Canterbury, and I prayed him to$N give the_answer shortly, after the Kyng’s mind as he$N knew it; for the matter was so new to me that I would$N go no further in it. Since that time I have diverse$N seasons asked him for the said answer, which I could<p. 91$N never have till now; and the same in a letter I sent$N you herein closed.

This matter has been debated$N and beaten 15 or 16 days to_gether: the highest necessity$N alleged on the King’s behalf to us that ever was$N heard of: and of the contrary, the highest poverty confessed,$N as well by knights, squires, and gentlemen of$N every quarter, as by the commoners, citizens,and burgesses.$N There has been such hold that the House$N was like to have been dissevered; that is to say the$N Knights being of the King’s Council, the King’s servants,$N and gentlemen, of the one party, which in so$N long time were spoken with and made to say yes; it<p. 221$N may fortune, contrarie to their heart, will, and conscience.$N Thus hanging this matter, yesterday the$N more part being the King’s servants, gentlemen, were$N there assembled; and so they being the more part,$N willed and gave to the King 2 shillings of the pound of goods or$N lands, the beste to be taken for the King, all lands to$N pay 2 shillings of the pound from the lowest to the highest; the$N goods to pay 2 shillings of the pound from 20 pounds upwards; and$N from 40 shillings. of goods to 20 pounds to pay 16 pence of the pound and$N under 40 shillings every person to pay 8 pence this to be payed$N in 2 years.    I have heard no man in my life that can$N remember that ever there was given to any one of the$N King’s ancestors half so_much at one grant; nor I$N think there was never such a president seen before$N this time,    I beseech almighty God it may be well$N and peaceably levied, and surely payed unto the King’s$N Grace with_out grudge, and specially with_out losing$N the good wills and true hearts of his subjects,$N which I reckon a far greater treasure for a King than$N gold or silver.   And the gentlemen which must take$N pain to levy this money amongst the King’s subjects I$N think shall_have no little business about the same.$N My lord Cardinal has promised on his faith$N that the 2 shillings of the pound of lone money shall_be payed with$N a good will and with thank. But no day is appointed$N thereof.$N I think now that this matter is so far passed$N that the parliament will soon be ended.$N As_to the convocation amongst the priests, the first<p. 222$N day of their appearance as_soon as mass of the holy$N ghost at Paul’s was done, my lord Cardinal cited$N all them to appear before him in his convocation at$N Westminster which so did: and there was a_nother$N mass of the holy ghost: and within 6 or 7 days,$N the priests proved that all that my lord Cardinal’s convocation$N should do, it should be void, because that$N their summons was to appear before my Lorde of Canterbury;$N which thing so espied, my lorde Cardinal$N has addressed out of new citations in_to every country$N commanding the priests to appear before him 7$N days after the Ascension; and then I think they shall_have$N the 3rd mass of the Holy Ghost. I pray God$N the holy ghost be amongst them and us both. I$N do tremble to remember the end of all this high and$N new enterprises: for often_times it has been seen$N that to a new enterprise there follows a new manner$N and strange sequel. God of his mercy send his$N grace of such fashion that it may be all for the best.$N To ascertain you of the King of Denmark's being$N in Flanders with 16 ships with his wife and children$N meseems I should not write it unto you, because$N I think you be_(are) advertised thereof by post.$N How this 2 shillings of the pound shall_be levied, of what manner$N or at what days it shall_be paid, in good faith I$N know not as yet.$N Out of Spain we have news that there is a truce$N or abstinence of war taken between the emperor and<p. 223$N them of France. And I think now that this money$N is granted, so shall it be with us.$N Under yourgood favour meseems, and if you think$N it best, it were a gracious deed for you, to be mean$N unto the King’s Highness that 10 or 12 thousand pounds of this$N money might be bestowed on the building up again$N of the piles and castles on our English borders;$N specially now that they of Scotland be prostrate by$N your good and high policy.$N As other news or affairs shall chance so shall$N I be glad with diligence to advertise you of from time to$N time.$N My Lord Privyseal, my Lord Vaux, and Sir Thomas$N Lovell be all 3 right sick at this present day,$N and as it is said Lord Vaux in great danger.

For his Grace$N thinks it a great hindrance to the come affairs that the Emperor$N should grant any such safe conduct, whereby there should be$N any mutual intercourse between his subjects and their common$N enemies, and the commodities of France having vent and utterance,$N the enemy thereby the better furnished of money, should be$N the more able  the longer to maintain the war. And so shall$N it be the longer ere he shall incline to any reasonable conditions$N of peace. Wherefore his Grace for his part according to your Grace's$N political advice is as yet in mind neither to ratify that safe conduct,$N nor to grant any like, and is glad that your Grace so$N showed unto the Emperors ambassador.$N   It may further like your good Grace to be advertised that one$N Thomas Murner, a friar of Saint Francisco order, which wrote$N a book against Luther in defence of the King’s book, was out$N of Allemagne/*Germany sent in to England by the means of a simple person,<p. 277$N an Allemand/*German naming him self servant unto the King’s Grace$N and affirming unto murner that the King had given him in$N charge to desire Murner to come over to him into England, and$N by the occasion thereof, he has come over and has now been here$N a good while. Wherefore the King’s Grace pitying that he was so$N deceived and having tender respect to the good zeal that he$N bears toward the faith and his good heart and mind toward his$N Highnesss, requires your Grace that it may like you to cause$N him have in reward one hundred pound, and that he may$N return home where his presence is very necessary, for he is$N one of the chief stays against the faction of Luther in that$N parties, against whom he has written many books in the Allemand/*German$N tongue and now since his coming hither he has translated$N In to Latin the book that he before made in Almaigne in defence$N of the King’s book. He is Doctor of Divinity and of both laws$N and a man for writing and preaching of great estimation in his$N country.$N   It may like your Grace further to know that the same simple$N person which caused Murner to come in to England has now come$N to the Court and has brought with him a baron’s son of$N Allemagne/*Germany, to whom he has also persuaded that the King’s$N Grace would be glad to have him in his service. He has also$N brought letters from Duke Ferdinand unto the King’s Grace,$N which letters I send unto your Grace, wherein he desires the$N King’s Highness to take in to his service and to retain with some$N convenient yearly pension Ducem Mechelburgensem, of which$N request the King’s Grace greatly marvels and verily thinks$N that this simple fellow which brought the letters, likewise as he$N caused Murner to cum hither and persuaded the barons son that$N the King would be glad to have his service, so has, by some simple$N ways brought the Duke of Mechelborough in the mind that the$N King’s Grace would at the contemplation of Duke Ferdinand’s$N letters be content to retain the Duke of Mechelborough with a$N verily pension. The fellow has brought also from the Duke of$N Mechelborough letters of credence written in the Dutch tongue.$N He bare him self in Allemagne/*Germany for the King’s servant and$N boasted that he had a yearly pension of his Grace of fifty marks$N and that the King had sent him thither to take up servants for<p. 278$N him. And now he says he is servant unto the Emperors Majesty$N and is going in to Spain with letters to him and indeed he$N has diverse letters to his Majesty, and so was it easy for him$N to get, if he intended to deceive and mock, as the King’s Grace$N thinks that he does. For his Grace never saw him before, but$N he understands now that before this time he was in England$N when the Emperor was here and slew a man and escaped his way.$N Wherever his Grace requires yours to give him your prudent$N advice as well in a convenient answer to be made both to Duke$N Ferdinand and the Duke of Mechelborough as also in what$N wise it shall be convenient to order this simple fellow, that so has$N deceived men in the King’s name.$N   Furthermore it may like your good Grace to understand that$N at the contemplation of your Grace's letters, the King’s Highness is$N graciously content that beside the 100 pounds for my fe, for the office of the$N Speaker of his Parliament, to be taken at the receipt of his Exchequer,$N I shall have one other hundred pounds out of his coffers,$N by the hands of the Treasurer of his Chamber, wherefore in most$N humble wise I beseech your good Grace that as your gracious$N favour has obtained it for me so it may like the same to write$N to Mr. Wiatt that he may deliver it to such as I shall send for$N it, whereby I and all mine, as the manifold goodness of your$N Grace has already bound us, shall be daily more and more bound$N to pray for your Grace, whom our Lord long preserve in$N honour and health.

For now, if upon the exhibition of$N the said commissions, I should not fail in treaty with them, upon$N the King’s said entree, there might thereby be given unto them$N vehement cause of suspicion; which, percase/*perhaps, might drive them$N the rather in to the Emperor’s devotion, and the less hereafter to$N esteem the King’s Highness.$N   Wherefore I purpose, if it shall so stand with the King’s pleasure,$N whereof I pray you I may be advertised by your next letters, after$N the French King’s commission shall be here arrived, if they vehemently$N press me, to begin to common with them upon the$N King’s said entree, for the avoiding of the said suspicion. Albeit,$N as well for the ordering of matters between us and France, as for$N the assurance of the King’s pension, with other things that I shall$N reasonably lay in the way, I did not so to entreat the articles$N of this new treaty, that the time of doing any thing this year$N shall be well passed, or any conclusion may be taken therein in the$N same. And in my poor opinion, it shall more stand with the$N King’s honour and reputation thus to proceed with the said$N ambassadors than not to treat with them; considering they be$N furnished with such commissions, as was or is devised and desired$N by the King’s Highness.$N   Better it shall be thus to pass the time, and deal with them,$N than now to make any express refusal, either of the King’s<p. 367$N said entree, or else to delay to common and treat upon the same;$N LAT_nam LAT_inter LAT_tractandum LAT_varia LAT_occurrere LAT_et LAT_incidere LAT_possint, LAT_que LAT_rem,$N LAT_ut LAT_tua LAT_prudentia LAT_facile LAT_perspicit, LAT_citra LAT_suspitionem, LAT_differe LAT_et LAT_protelare$N LAT_queant.$N   It is somewhat to my marvel, that the King’s Highness, as I have$N by mine other letters signified unto you, makes difficult for the$N lending of the Peter Pumgarnet to the ambassador of France,$N considering the manifold good deserts of the said ambassador,$N and the great profit and commodity that shall arise unto his Grace$N thereby. And in my judgement, it is not to be suspected or feared that$N she shall or may be used by the said ambassador against the King’s$N Highness, in any hostility, considering that the sureties shall be$N bound as well for that point, as for her redelivery at the year's$N end; and then there is more lightness of straighter collection with$N France, than of any breach. And where as your letters purposes,$N that the King’s Highness may have five hundred marks for$N the loan of the said ship, besides the advantage of his customs$N of his own subjects; and thereunto it is to be considered, that the$N customs of the strangers amounts far above the customs of$N his own subjects. Wherever for one hundred pound paid by$N the Englishmen, the strangers pays nine hundred. Besides this,$N I suppose if the King have, for the loan of her, five hundred$N marks, his Grace must new rig, trim and tackle her at his$N own cost and charge, which percase will surmount the same$N of the said five hundred marks; whereas the Ambassador offers$N to do the same at his own proper express cost and charge.$N Moore than this I cannot say, remitting all to the King’s noble$N pleasure and gratitude; most humbly beseeching his grace to have$N consideration of such good office, as the said ambassador has,$N and daily may do, for the advancement of his present affairs.$N   I send unto the King’s Highness by my Lord of Exeter, bearer$N hereof, certain of the Crowns of the Rose as be newly struck$N and coined in the King’s Mint; which be of like finesse and$N poise as the Crown Soleil, and as you do know, the same be$N proclaimed to be current after the rate of 4 s. 6 d. apiece. I trust<p. 368$N the faction of them shall please the King’s Highness. You may$N show unto his Grace, that I would suffer none of them to pass$N out of his Mint, and be current, unto such time as his Grace$N had seen the print and faction of the same, and his pleasure notified$N unto me thereupon, accordingly.$N   And where as you have notified unto me, that the King’s pleasure$N I s, that his Grace's answer to Luther’s letter should be immediately$N sent forth to the princes of Allemagne/*Germany, without abiding or tarrying$N for the copy thereof, I think therein that me seems it is not$N convenient that this should be done, in my poor opinion; as well$N for that Luther, who is full of subtlety and craft, hereafter might$N percase deny that any such letter has been sent by him unto the$N King’s Highness, as that the said answer, not having the said copy$N adjoined thereunto, should be, for want thereof, to the readers and$N hearers thereof, somewhat diminute and obscure and not perfectly$N perceived by them that shall read the same.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 152<Author(s)/writer(s): Queen Ann Boleyn (1507-1536)<Place of author: x<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: -40 (21)<Status of author: royal<Recipient: Cardinal Wolsey<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: my lord; you<Relation of correspondents:distance; respect<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1528<Century (in quarters): 2/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<Anne Boleyn to Cardinal Wolsey (1528)<Original letters illustrative of English history, eds.

For in this$N matter of the Nun of Canterbury I have unto your$N trusty Counsellor, master Thomas Cromwell, by my$N writing as plainly declared the truth as * I possibly *$N can; which my declaration, * as I understand, * is$N made known to your noble Grace.<p. 184$N   Of all my dealinge with the Nun, whether any$N other man may peradventure put any doubt, or move$N any scruple of any other meaning than I had, that can$N I neither tell, nor lies in my hand to let, but unto$N my self it is not possible any part of my demeanour$N to seem evil; And this the clearness of my conscience$N testifying that in that matter, my mind, intent and$N proceeding was lawful and good.

Which, if your Highness do not (as I trust in$N God and your great goodness, the matter by your wisdom$N well examined, you will not) then in most humble manner$N I beseech your Highness further, since your Highness has$N here before of your mere abundant goodness heaped$N on me both worship and honour, and since now I have$N left of all such things, and nothing seek or desire but$N the life to come, and to pray for your Grace the$N while, that it may like your Highness of your accustomed$N benignity somewhat to tender my poor honesty, and$N never to suffer any man by means of such a bill, to take$N occasion against the truth to slander me; although$N this by the peril of their own souls would do them$N more hurt then me, for I setle my heart to depend$N upon the comfort of the truth and the hope of heaven,$N and not upon the fallible opinion of some changeable$N persons.$N   And thus, most dread and dear sovereign Lord,$N I beseech the blessed Trinity * preserve your noble$N Grace, both body and soul, and all that are your$N well willers, and amend the contrary; among whom,$N If ever I be, or ever have been one, then I pray God that$N he may with my open shame and destruction declare it.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 157<Author(s)/writer(s): Sir Thomas More, 1478-1535<Place of author: Easthamstead<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Margaret<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: personal<Relation of correspondents: family; father to daughter<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1535<Century (in quarters): 2/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Thomas More to his daughter Margaret (1535),<The Life of Sir Thomas Moore, eds.

Whereunto I answered that in good$N faith I had well trusted that his Highness would never$N have commanded any such question to be asked of me,<p. 215$N considering that I ever from the beginning well and truly$N declared my mind to his Majesty, and also unto your$N Mastership, both by mouth and writing; and now I$N have discharged my mind of all such matters, meaning$N not hereafter to dispute King’s or Popes titles. I am$N the King’s faithful subject, and will be, and daily pray$N for him and all his Realm, and otherwise then this I$N Intend not to meddle. Whereunto master Secretary$N answered that he thought that this manner of answer$N would not satisfy the King’s Highness; for that his Grace$N expected a more full answer, and that to the purpose.$N And he added that the King was a Prince not of rigour$N but of mercy and pity, and though he had found$N obstinacy in any of his Subjects at some time, yet if$N they submitted themselves, his Grace would show$N mercy. And for you, master More, I know so much$N that his Grace would be glad to see you take such conformable$N ways that you might be abroad again, with$N a great credit and worship as ever you were. Whereunto$N I answered I would not meddle in the world again,$N to have all the world given me, as in effect I answered$N before.<p. 216$N   "Then was I commanded to go forth awhile, and$N presently called in again. Then said master Secretary$N unto me, Though you are a prisoner condemned to$N perpetual imprisonment, yet thereby I was not discharged$N of my allegiance to his Highness, and whereupon he demanded$N whither I thought his Highness might not$N exact a direct answer of me, of such things as might$N be demanded, as of any other, I answered that I$N thought his Highness might. Then, said he, that like as$N his Highness would be gracious to them that he found$N conformable, so his Grace fully determined to follow$N the course of the law towards such as shall show$N themselves wilful and obstinate; and your demeanour$N In this matter, master More, has made many so stiff$N therein as they be. Whereunto I answered that I$N gave no man occasion, neither by word nor writing,$N to hold on the one side or the other. And for conclusion$N I would go no further, whatsoever pain should me$N befall. For I am the King’s true faithful subject and$N beadsman.

And first, for as much that you may peradventure$N judge, that I, moved only by the high authority wherein it has$N pleased the King’s Highness most worthily to set you, so much$N desire by your special preferment to be set forward to the King’s$N service now at this time, I shall beseech you of your gentleness not$N to take me so, for, albeit that by your authority I will not deny I$N am somewhat moved indeed, yet certainly this to you I will$N affirm, if there were not other causes joined thereto which more$N sharply stir and prick my mind than does that, I, being to you$N so unknown as I am, would never have tempted nor enterprised$N such a purpose with you: for if I had not found at such time as I$N first saluted you at home, a singular humanity and gentleness in you$N and if I had not much heard of your goodness in setting forward at$N honest purposes, you and if I had not seen and perceived your$N excellent wisdom and your other virtues, most worthy of all high$N authority, I think I had never conceived this purpose, I think I$N had never set my self in this case, wherein my special trust is more$N to be to you bound than in the rest of my life with any service$N I can deserve; for of this I assure you I am not of so vile and base$N of stomach as for to obtain and benefit worldly, to desire to be$N bound to any man whom I can_not with heart and mind reverently$N both honour and love. Wherever of this I shall beseech you to be<p. 10$N persuaded ever surely to have in me such a heart and stomach as is$N convenient to be in him, who to you of all other shall be most$N bound. And now, Sir, to the intent that you may somewhat perceive$N such poor qualities as be/*are in me, and so thereupon with your$N benevolent mind you may set forward somewhat better my purpose,$N I shall bravely show unto you the order, process, and end of all my$N studies. First, here in Oxford a great part of my youth I occupied$N my self in the study of philosophy, joining thereto the knowledge of$N both tongues both Latin and Greek, and so after passed over in_to--$N Italy, whereas I so delighted in the contemplation of natural knowledge ----$N wherein the most part of men lettered there occupy themselves -- that$N many times I was purposed to have spent the rest of my life wholly$N therein, till at the last, moved by Christian charity, philosophy set$N apart, I applied my self to the reading of holy scripture, judging all$N other secret knowledge not applied to some use and profit of other to be$N but as a vanity. Wherefore in the study of holy letters certain years I$N spent, after the which, because my purpose then was to live in a$N political life, I set my self now these last years past to the knowledge$N of the civil Law, that I might thereby make a more stable and$N sure judgement of the political order and customs used among us here$N in our country. After this manner in diverse kinds of studies I have$N occupied my self, ever having in mind this end and purpose at the last$N here in this community where I am brought forth and borne to$N employ them to some use; and though in them I have not most$N profited, yet diligence and will has not lacked thereto: but what so$N ever it is that I have by the goodness of God attained unto I shall$N most gladly, after your judgement and advice, apply it to the service$N of our prince, and thereby reckon my self to attain a great part$N of my felicity. Wherever I beseech you, sir, as you of your only$N goodness have begun, so at your pleasure and convenient leasure to help$N forward thus my purpose, and then shall I be to you more bound$N than I am yet to any mortal man living.$N                          Your assured servant$N                           Thomas Starkey.<Endorsed$N               to Mr Secretary Cromwell touching the course of his$N Life, studies and Travels.$N End_of_1534.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 160<Author(s)/writer(s): Thomas Starkey (1478-1535)<Place of author: London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (55)<Status of author: political theorist and humanist<Recipient: Cardinal Pole<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Sir<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: upwards<Exact date: 1534<Century (in quarters): 2/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<Thomas Starkey to Cardinal Pole (1534),<England in the Reign of Henry the Eighth, ed.

Sir, as you know since our first acquaintance$N and familiarity many letters there has been at sundry times$N between us written, and much communication there has been also concerning<p. 14$N the institution of our lives, with such fidelity ministered$N upon both parties as was convenient to the sincereness of our hearts$N and minds, but if ever any of these you have judged to be worthy of$N remembrance, or yet do stick in your memory and mind, I beseech you$N let these few words which I now to you write be put in the number$N of them, with good advertisement and consideration of the same, for$N they concern the whole order of your life here after to be lead in$N this our country among your natural lovers and friends. Sir,$N I was but late by the singular gentleness of Master Secretary, whose$N goodness both toward me and also to you is so sunk in_to my breast, that$N during my life I shall ever reckon my self next to our prince above$N all other most faithfully to him bound, for in the court to the$N King’s service and by his most loving recommendations so graciously$N of his Highness accepted and admitted that shortly after it pleased$N the same to call me to his presence, and there of you, of your studies,$N and of your sentence and opinion in his grace's most weighty$N causes here late defined, most lovingly many things to demand;$N to the which I made such answer, as ever I have judged convenient to$N be made before the majesty of a prince; that is, such things as I$N know manifest and true plainly to affirm, and such whereof I stand$N In doubt by conjecture only to rehearse: and so your mind, heart and$N desire to do his grace true and faithful service, which I know no$N other wise than I know mine own, I boldly did affirm, but as$N touching your opinion in his grace’s late defined causes, one of the$N matrimony, the other concerning the authority of the pope, for as much$N as you ever have used this prudent silence never to disclose your$N sentence and mind but in time and place, I could not of your opinion$N any thing therein plainly affirm, but yet this to his Highness I$N said and surely I thought, that as far as your learning and judgement, which$N I esteemed by time and diligent study somewhat was altered and$N increased, also touching the discerning between God’s law and man’s$N would stretch and extend, all your power and all such knowledge and learning as$N by the goodness of God and his grace’s liberality you had obtained and$N got, to the maintaining of such things as his grace’s wisdom by$N court of parliament therein had decreed, you would gladly confer to the$N honour of his Highness and wealth of his realm.  This much I said,$N this far I went, but his grace not satisfied therewith, desiring to$N have your sentence therein plainly declared, commanded me this$N now to write to you, that his pleasure was that you should like a learned$N man, all assertion by any cause rising set aside, in those 2 causes<p. 15$N ponder and weigh the nature of the things as they be/*are in them self/*selves,$N and putting a-part all successes and dangerous effects which of them$N may ensue, leaving all such things to his grace’s wisdom and his$N policy, declare your sentence truly and plain without colour or cloak$N of dissimulation, (which his grace most princely abhors), not$N willing you of these things to make any great volume or book but$N briefly to gather the most effectual reasons which in your stomach$N be/*are of most weight, and them to set forth after your plain fashion and$N manner of writing this was his grace’s pleasure and commandment that$N I should to you write, which I have as near as my memory would serve$N me therein truly and faithfully now to you exercised. now, sir,$N consider and prudently weigh how princely a request this is of our$N prince, and then I am sure you will employ your self with all$N diligence and study to satisfy his noble desire, to the which also$N master Secretary, (whose most loving goodness towards you gives place$N to no man) mostly gently does exhort you, willing you also in any$N case, what so ever your sentence in these causes shall be, to use your$N wont and customed plains/*complaints with prudent simplicity, and me upon his$N behalf this to certify you, that in case be your learning and judgement$N in these matters of weight would stretch and extend to the satisfying of$N the King’s desire and mind, that then your return hither to your$N country should be greatly to the King’s pleasure, to your own comfort,$N and much profit to the rest of your friends; you and yet further, if so be/*is$N that your knowledge and learning would not serve you to this purpose and$N request of the King, yet notwithstanding would he advise you, of a$N tender and loving mind, to prepare yourself at your convenient$N leasure towards your country, doubting no thing but that the King’s$N Highness in other his causes and his affairs shall use your service and$N most loving and servisable mind. For sorry he is that there among$N strangers without profit to your country your virtues should be so$N utterly drowned and like as in a dream vanish away. Whereby, Sir,$N you may plainly perceive the gentleness of his stomach and singular$N goodness to all men of honesty, which to you almost unacquainted and of$N small familiarity bears such mind, moved only by the opinion of$N virtue, which to him fame has reported, in so much that this he$N willed me now by my letters of his goodness and benevolent mind,$N so to assure you, that in all such things as might touch your$N preferment to my lady your mother and my Lord your brother whom$N nature so straightly binds only he would give place: wherein he<p. 16$N shows so gently a stomach that I dare this boldly now say that$N if ever hereafter it shall be your chance presently here of this$N mind in him experience to take, you shall as I do for his virtues$N and not only for his authority have him in stable and reverent love,$N such is his wisdom and in matters of state his high policy. and$N thus now you have heard the most prudent advice and singular$N benevolence of master Secretary, to the which I doubt not but that$N with great gladness you will apply yourself, willing thereby to$N satisfy our princes pleasure and desire. And now, Sir, for because since$N our last departure out of our country little communication concerning$N these matters has been between us had, I will now adjoin these$N few words unto you.  (6) Ponder you well this levitical law and how$N it is rooted in the law of nature, and how by general conseil it has$N been many times declared and authorised thereby, and further how$N upon the other side the slenderness of this long usurped and abused$N authority of the pope, which by patience of princes, simplicity of$N the people, and ambitious avarice of his predecessors, in process of$N time by little and little is grown to this intolerable iniquity, and$N then I think that you shall see in these causes the judged truth and$N plain equity. But all this I leave to your own consideration and$N judgement, praying to him, of whom to all men comes all light, that$N by his light and grace you may see the truth, and so then to set it$N forth that it may be comfort to our prince, pleasure to your self$N and to all other here your lovers and friends. And this now, sir, I will$N make an end, finishing my letters with comfortable news that$N all such rumour and fame which by men of corrupt judgement not having$N discretion to judge and discern between very and true religion and light$N and false superstition since was in Italy you divulged, is utterly false and$N full of vanity. For of this doubt you nothing, that albeit upon$N many reasonable and just causes our most noble prince has withdrawn$N himself from the pope's authority, yet from the certain and$N sure grounds of scripture his grace in no point is slid, no nor yet$N from the laws nor ceremonies of the church, the which yet stand in$N full strength and authority; and so they shall boldly I dare affirm,$N until such time that to his Highness and to his most wise conseil it$N shall appear expedient them to abrogate and other to substitute by$N common assent more agreeable to this time and to the nature of our$N men, and also to our whole country more convenient. here is no thing$N down without due order and reasonable mean; here is touching<p. 17$N religion nothing almost altered at all but that which was of all other$N most necessary, which is, as I trust, and shall be a very ground and a$N foundation to civil order and a true and right policy. this is the$N state here, and of this one thing I do you assure, if I had found$N truth in deed these things which by misreport there with you were$N commonly said, as that our prince should be slipped also from the$N grounds of scripture, from the honour of the sacraments, and from$N all the common laws and wholesome ceremonies of the church without$N order, I would never have been so without sense or stomach of an$N honest man, as at this time to have sought to enter to his service;$N for the desire which I have long nourished in my breast to serve this$N our master and prince is in this stable, and I trust ever shall be, in his$N service to serve God and my country, to the which purpose the rest of my$N life I will now dedicate to his grace and with such heart and mind$N serve him withal as is convenient to a true faithful and Christian$N subject toward his most noble and catholic prince: this is my mind$N and I am sure the same is yours, the which I trust in facts you shall$N have place shortly to declare and this I commit you to God.   At$N London the 15 of February,$N                       By yours assured,$N                          Thomas Starkey.<Endorsed$N              Thomas Starkey to his friend in Italy wishing him to$N give his opinion to the King’s grace touching his opinion for the$N altering of religion and the abolishing of the pope's authority.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 161<Author(s)/writer(s): Thomas Starkey (1478-1535)<Place of author: Oxford<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: political theorist and humanist<Recipient: Cardinal Pole<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Sir<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: upwards<Exact date: 1535<Century (in quarters): 2/16<Educational background: poor spelling<Dialect: standard; Latin style<Thomas Starkey To Cardinal Pole (1535),<England in the Reign of Henry the Eighth, ed. Herrtage, pp. 28-31.$N   (1) Sir. You wrote before in our prince’s cause of your own$N mission: wherein you showed lovingly the dangers that might of$N his cause follow, but the matter it_self as it is here by the King$N most sharply judged you did not almost touch.  Wherefore now the$N King, as I have written, requires your learned judgement: and that you$N should leave your prudent and witty policy till you be/*are required.$N The points be/*are these, which though you right well of your self know$N yet I will put them a little after my mind before your eyes.$N   (2) An LAT_matrimonium LAT_cum LAT_relicta LAT_fratris, LAT_ab LAT_eo LAT_cognita, LAT_sit LAT_iure$N LAT_divino LAT_licitum.$N   In this and the rest also, though the King’s pleasure be you$N should give place to no man’s persuasion nor authority, as I am$N sure you will not; yet for the love that I bear unto you and for the$N desire that I have that you should see the judged truth, I will note$N certain places of weight after mine opinion in these things to$N be considered, ever leaving your own judgement free.$N   (3) And first, for this point consider how this law is rooted in$N nature: ponder it by this rule if it seem/*seems to you good: all$N thing which binds man to the observation thereof: all law written$N put aside for the conservation of the civil political life universally$N convenient to the dignity? of the nature of man: all such I$N think is rooted in the law of nature. Apply thys rule without$N affection and with a right you examine it in this case.$N   And then for the second point, an liceat dispensare, easy I think$N it shall be to find the pope’s power extends not thereto. And<p. 29$N though it were expedient for the wordly policy for to have dispensation,$N as it was peradventure in the King’s cause, yet it is$N not expedient any one man to have such power to break such Law$N so rooted in nature, and upon this ground it appears to me further$N that the pope should not have power not only to dispense with$N any law so rooted in nature, but also that he has not power (nor$N convenient it is that he should have): yes? though he were made$N head of the church power to dispense with laws made in general$N conseil, catholic laws, and universal grounds, ordained for the$N conservation of Christian life in all Christ’s church, and though he$N has used the contrary, it was, I think, a misuse and usurped by$N the reason whereof now it is spied?, now it does fall, now it is$N plucked justly away.$N   Look also and ponder this whether ever the whole authority of$N making, of abrogating, of dispensing with catholic laws and$N universal grounds of Christian living, were ever given and translated$N to the pope by any law written in general counsel, which were$N necessary to find if we should attribute such authority. as to the$N emperor’s we find LAT_legem LAT_regiam LAT_qua LAT_potestas LAT_senatus and LAT_populi LAT_erat$N LAT_in LAT_principem LAT_collata.$N   (4) The second principal matter: - an LAT_superioritas LAT_quam LAT_multis LAT_in$N LAT_seculis LAT_romanus LAT_pontifex LAT_sibi LAT_vindicavit LAT_sit LAT_ex LAT_iure LAT_divino. Here you$N must weigh the places of the gospel and scripture, wherein I think you$N shall find non manifestly proving that; the common places you know$N how that they are understood contrary thereby diverse and many, as when$N the disciples of Christ contended for superiority you know what$N Christ said; you know how Paul confesses he knows only Christ$N for heed, civil and political heeds he confessed many, sed iure divino$N nullum. Further look to the beginning of the church when the$N truth thereof was better known than it is now. In the acts of$N the apostles you shall find no such thing, and after the apostles’$N days the 4 patriarchs of Jerusalem, of Antioch, of Constantinople,$N of Rome had among them no superiority.$N   (5) Look further how the Greeks fell from the church catholic as$N we call now, chiefly for because the bishop of Rome would be chief$N head; you know what is to be given to the judgement of the Greeks$N in the interpretation of scripture better than I do.<p. 30$N   The contention between Peter and Paul takes away such superiority$N as is given to the successors of Peter$N   Ponder why more from the bishop of Antioch than of Rome$N such superiority is taken a_way seeing Peter was bishop of both.$N   (6) These certain points I now write to you, LAT_non LAT_quia LAT_preiudicium$N LAT_aliquod LAT_afferrent: the King’s pleasure is that you should, without any$N prejudicial affection taken of any man upon one part or other, with$N a sincere mind and with that light that God has given you in$N scriptures and learning give your sentence. And as touching the policy$N of both the matters and of bringing them to effect, which his grace$N has now done whether it be/*is well done or if he requires no$N judgement of you, as of one that in such things has no great experience$N as yet. As whether it be convenient that there should be one$N head in the church and that to be the bishop of Rome, set this aside,$N and in his cause of matrimony, whether the policy that he has used$N therein be/*is profitable to his realm or no, leave that aside; only  show$N you whether, if the first matrimony were to make, whether you would$N approve that then or no, and the cause why you would not, and thus$N weigh the thing in it self as it is in his own nature and put a$N part fear of all dangers, hope of all good which should succeed and$N hangs upon worldly policy, and so clearly without affection either$N of King or Queen bravely give your sentence. And thus you shall first$N honour God and truth; and second also satisfy the King, which said to$N me these words,  that rather he had you were buried there than you$N should for any worldly promotion and profit to your self dissemble$N with him in these great and weighty causes.$N   Thus you have my mind and the King’s pleasure withal, and if$N case be/*is that you reach to the judged truth, you need not to fear, after$N my mind, that men should lay to you lightness of mind and changing$N of sentence, for as far as I can conjecture you did affirm nothing$N in the cause as was convenient for arrogance it any thing$N affirm but only that which by the word of God we have declared$N to us, wherefore you did only put before his yes the dangers$N which hanged/*hung upon worldly policy. If I remember this you do, I$N can not well tell for I never see nor read your book but ones as you$N know well, at the which time it seemed to me you wrote so probably$N that it put me in a fear of dangers to come, but I trust<p. 31$N the goodness of God and providence of our most wise prince shall avert$N and turn all such calamity by man’s conjecture foreseen from this$N our country.$N   Direct your knowledge if you see need by master Gaspero, the$N bishop of Chete, with other such men of his learning and judgement.<incomplete--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 162<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Boorde<Place of author: Bordeaux<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: x<Status of author: clergy<Recipient: Thomas Cromwell<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: none<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: upwards<Exact date: 1535<Century (in quarters): 2/16<Educational background: poor spelling<Dialect: x<Andrew Boorde to Thomas Cromewell (1535),<Andrew Borde, letter II, ed.

Merriman, no. 340, p. 253.<Mar. 12, [1540].$N   Mr. Wallop after my right hearty commendations where the$N King’s Majesty has received certain advertisements from$N a very good place which his Majesty thinks does much$N touch his good brother the French King. And that it were$N very expedient he had knowledge of the same. His Highness$N has thought convenient to write the same unto you to$N the intent you may declare them to the Queen of Navarre$N which his Highness would you should do at your first opportunity.$N The particulars be/*are these. First his Majesty is$N advised that the Constable and Cardinal of Lorrien shall at$N their coming in to Flanders rather be entertained with$N cheer to show an appearance of amity than grow to any$N conclusion of things according to the French King’s desire.$N Second it is advertised how the legate for Farneze by his$N Governor Marsselles did move the French King lately by$N the bishop of Rome’s commandment to make difficulty$N a while in his conclusion between him and the Emperor,$N saying that the necessity of the Emperor should thereby cause$N him to have what he would desire, Whereunto the French$N King should answer that if the Emperor would live as he$N does in peace and friendship he would do his best always$N to show like correspondence. But if he would treat any$N further thing it must be for all dependants or else nothing.$N The latter end of his saying, that is to say, the French$N King’s answer only was secretly reported to the_Emperor.$N And when the reporter said that all dependants included$N many things as well Burgoyn Navarre treaties of Madril as$N Milan and Piemont, the Emperor answered that of truth$N the things were marvellously intricate, adding that at the$N treating at Perpignon he being then at Barcelona, he$N thought it not best to come to any particulars and even$N so would be loath yet to come to them for, quoth he, there is$N danger of unhonest conditions or of discontentment at$N departing. And therefore it is thought and said that to$N win a further delay the King of Romaynez shall also$N go to visit the French King and by these means shall$N the Emperor thus win time and take his advantage in other$N parties having as the King’s Majesty is advised a secret$N fantasy in his head, that being the French King sickly and$N diseased (which is much to the King’s Highness regret) he$N devises how by means to protract and win looking for$N that which his grace trusts he shall not see and thinking if$N he were once passed he should easily enough frame all his$N purposes after even as he himself would wish and desire.$N Now you may require Madame de Navarre to consider what$N these things do savour and in case she shall think that the$N knowledge of them may anything confer to the French$N King’s benefit she may open the same at her pleasure and$N by one point she may presently know whether any of the$N rest be/*is like/*likely to be true that is by the words spoken by the$N French King himself touching the dependants wherein$N you may press her to take some pains to know the certainty$N as a means to way/weigh* the better the residue, albeit his Majesty$N doubts not but in case the constable do not grow to a$N thorough agreement but shall be put off by delays, new inventions$N and devises. His good brother, the French King, shall$N easily by the same convert the Emperor’s mind and purpose.$N And what answer she shall presently or upon deliberation$N and inquiry make unto you, His Majesty’s pleasure is you$N shall advertise with convenient diligence joining to your$N advertisements such other occurrences as you shall there$N learn from time to time worthy his graces knowledge. You$N may also show to the Queen of Navarre that in like manner$N from a good place his Majesty is advertised that in Spain$N they begin to murmur for that the Emperor should practise$N the marrying for himself and his children without their consents,$N saying they will keep a parliament upon that and$N such other matters whereupon it is thought he will send$N thither the Duke of Alva to do what he can to appease and$N quiet them whereby it appears that were it not only for$N the estimation that he has by the French King he were like/*likely$N shortly to have business enough to turn him to. Thus advising$N you that the King’s Highness is in good health with all$N your friends here I bid you heartily well to fare. From$N London the 12 of March$N    Endd.

I have$N written to my cousin, Henry Savill of Lapset, to go through$N with my Lord of Canterbury for it. According to the communication,$N and you and my cousin, John Gascoyne, shall have a part, if you will$N write to me that you will stick to it; and Robert Savill and Henry$N Savill of Lapset will stand to two parts. I think the woods will$N give us our money and more; and the lease clear to be gotten, for$N laying out of the money till we can make it again of the woods.$N I have sent you a rental of it, what it is, every close/*conclusion. I pray$N you let my cousin, John Gascoyne, see this letter and the rental.$N Keep it secret from all other. I pray God send us merry meeting.$N All written in my ship, at Timmoth.$N                      Your assured kinsman,$N                                   Henry Savill.$N   Cousin Gascoyne, your children are merry.<[Anno_circa_1543]--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 178<Author(s)/writer(s): Henry Savill<Place of author: Sothill (Dewsbury)<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: x<Status of author: gentry<Recipient: William Plumpton<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: personal<Relation of correspondents: family, cousins<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1544<Century (in quarters): 2/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<Henry Savill to William Plumpton (1544),<Plumpton Correspondence, ed.

You shall see your arrow$N fly and your greyhound run, and all those that comes with you,$N winter and summer, when it please you to come; as long as I live.$N As for the other matter, I pass not a little of it; I have yet weighed$N it with my council; and as you shall know at our meeting, as I am$N informed, and as I take it, there are many doubts by it. When I$N speak with you, I will hide nothing from you in this than in no$N other cause.  When you intend to come, let me know what time,$N or else you may hope neither to have me then nor my son at home;$N but my wife you shall be sure to find, and she will send some with$N you that shall let you see both rid and fallow, if you will take the$N pain. I have killed a hind or two of late, and they are very fat$N this year, both in the woods at Tankersley and in my garden at$N Thornehill. I think you were never yet in no ground of mine,$N and I never say no man nay. Therefore, the fault is in you and$N not in me; you may amend the fault when it pleases you. The cause$N of my sending of my servant at this time, is this; he informs$N me that in your country there is a man that can kill otters very<p. 248$N well; wherefore, I have sent him to get him to me for a week.

And if his brother$N die without issue, in all by gift he shall have 5 hundred mark$N land, (and if he were but inheritable by the law, he should be heir$N to him, but for default of heirship, I think he will not change his$N estate in this case;) and for default of heirs of my body lawfully begotten,$N he shall inherit all that I have.

The$N cause of my writing to you is for that Roger Ramy said to me,$N he thought you would about Low Sunday be at Thornhill. You$N shall come to a old house clean down, and as yet little amended.$N but you shall be welcome, as I can think. I would be sorry that$N you should take pain, and I not at home when you come. Tomorrow$N begging Thursday, I must of force ride to Tankerslay, 8$N miles hence, and meet my Lord of Shrewsburry, who will be there$N tomorrow by 2 of the clock, and see a shot at a stag, as my$N keeper has sent me word. And of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,$N there is appointed a great number of gentlemen to meet at$N Cocxs at Sheifield, where I intend, God willing, to be, and every$N night will lie at Tankerxlay; so it will be Friday ere/*before I come to<p. 251$N Thornhill, which is the 18 (14) of May. Wherefore, I desire$N you either put off your coming to that day, or take so much$N pain to come the 8 miles to Tankerxlay, where I have no$N lodging, but you shall have the best bed the keeper has; and$N you shall see a pollard or two, both rid and fallow, and see all our$N good cocks fight, if it pleases you, and see the manner of our$N cocking. There will be Lancashire of one part, and Derbishire$N of another part, and Hallomshire of the third part. I perceive$N your cocking varies from ours, for you lay but the battle;$N and if our battle be/*is but 10 pounds to 5 pounds, there will be 10 to one lay, or the$N battle be ended. And whenever you come, I require you take$N time to hunt with me for one week; bring bows and greyhounds,$N and at the time of the year, hounds. A pollard is sweet now, and I$N love it best now at this season; and by Whitsunday this year I shall$N have fat bucks. And ere any red dear be/*is fat, it will be$N July, as far as my experience serves. Come when you will, and such$N as I have, you shall see, and bring good stuff, for I warn you they$N are wild about Tankerxlay and ill to catch: and if all fail, I have$N that are tame enough.

Ellis, Vol. II,<LETTER CLXVI, pp. 156-158.$N My Lord, having received your Lordship’s letters,$N I perceive in them your goodwill towards me because$N you declare to me plainly your mind in this thing;$N and again for that you would not wish that I should$N do any thing that should not seem good unto the$N council, for the which thing I give you most hearty$N thanks.    And whereas I do understand that you do$N take in ivel part the letters that I did write unto your$N Lordship, I am very sorry that you should take them$N so for my mind was to declare unto you plainly as I$N thought in that thing, which I did also the more willingly$N because (as I write to you) you desired me to$N be plain with you in al things.   And as concerning$N that point that you write that I seem to stand in my$N own wit in being so well assured of my own self,$N I did assure me of my_self no more than I trust the$N truth shall try; and to say that which I knew of my_self$N I did not think should have displeased the council$N or your Grace.   And surely the cause why that$N I was sorry that there should be any such about me,$N was because that I thought the people will say that I deserved$N thought my lewd demeanour to have such a$N one, and not that I mislike any thing that your Lordship$N or the council shall think good, for I know$N that you and the council are charged with me; or that$N I take upon me to rule my_self, for I know they are$N most deceived that trust most in themselves, wherefore$N I trust you shall never find that fault in me, to<p. 157$N the which thing I do not see that your Grace has made$N any direct answer at this time, and seeing they make$N so evel reports already, shall be but an increasing of$N their evil tongues. Albeit you did write that if I would$N bring forth any that had reported it, you and the$N council would see it redressed, which thing thought I$N can easily do it, I would be loath to do it for because$N it is my own cause; and, again, that should be but a$N bridging of an evil name of me that am glad to punish$N them, and so get the evil will of the people, which thing$N I would be loath to have. But if it might so seem$N good unto your Lordship and the rest of the council$N to send forth a proclamation in_to the countries$N that they refrain their tongues, declaring how the tales$N be but lies, it should make both the people think that$N you and the council have great regard that no such$N rumours should be spread of any of the King’s Majesty’s$N sisters, as I am, though unworthy, and also I$N should think myself to receive such friendship at$N your hands as you have promised me, although your$N Lordship has showed me great already. Albeit$N I am ashamed to ask it any more, because I see you$N are not so well minded thereunto. And as concerning$N that you say that I give folks occasion to think in$N refusing the good to uphold the evil, I am not of so$N simple understanding, nor I would that your Grace$N should have so evil an opinion of me that I have so little<p. 158$N respect to my own honesty that I would maintain$N it if I had sufficient promise of the same, and so your$N Grace shall prove me when it comes to the point, And$N thus I bid you farewell, desiring God always to assist$N you in al your affairs.

Which thing I do not to favour$N her in any evel, (for that I would be sorry to do,) but$N for these considerations which follow, the which hope$N does teach me in saying that I ought not to doubt$N but that your Grace and the rest of the council will$N think that I do it for the other considerations. First,$N because that she has been with me a long time, and$N many years, and has taken great labor, and pain$N in bringing of me up in learning and honesty, and$N therefore I ought of very duty speak for her, for$N Saint Gregory says that we are more bound to them$N that bring us up well than to our parents, for our$N parents do that which is natural for them, that is bring$N us into this World; but our bringers up are a$N cause to make us live well in it.    The second is because$N I think that whatsoever she has done in my$N Lord Admiral’s matter as concerning the marrying$N of me, she did it because knowing him to be one$N of the council, she thought he would not go about any$N such thing without he had the council’s consent<p. 155$N thereunto; for I have heard her many times say that$N she would never have me marry in any place without$N your Grace’s and the council’s consent. The third$N cause is because that it shall and doth make men think$N that I am not clear of the deed myself, but that it is$N pardoned in me because of my youth, because that she$N I loved so well is in such a place. Thus hope prevailing$N more with me than fear, hath won the battle;$N and I have at this time gone further with it. Which$N I pray God be taken no other ways that it is meant.$N Written in haste. From Hatfield this 7 day of March.$N Also if I may be so bold not offending I beseech$N your Grace and the rest of the council to be good to$N master Aschiley her husband, which because he is my$N kinsman I would be glad he should do well.$N Your assured friend to my little$N power$N ELIZABETH.$N To my very good Lord my Lord Protector.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 193<Author(s)/writer(s): Mary Queen of Scots *1542, by the hand of a secretary<Place of author: Dunbar, Scotland<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: -40 (24)<Status of author: royal<Recipient: Lords of Elizabeth’s Council<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Cousins; 3ou/3e<Relation of correspondents: formal/friendly<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1566<Century (in quarters): 3/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: Scottish<Mary Queen of Scots to the Lords of Queen Elizabeth's Council (1566),<Original Letters, ed.

Ellis, Vol. II,<LETTER CXCIV, pp. 247-251.$N MADAME$N Although the necessity of my cause (which$N makes me to be importune to you) do make you to$N judge that I am out of the way, yet such as have not$N my passion, nor the respects whereof you are persuaded,$N will think that I do as my cause doth require.$N Madame I have not accused you, neither in words$N nor in thought, to have used your_self evil towards$N me; and I believe that you have no want of good understanding$N to keep you from persuasion against$N your natural good inclination. But in the mean_time$N I cannot choose (having my senses) but perceive$N very evil furtherance in my matters, since my coming$N hither. I thought that I had sufficiently discoursed$N unto you the discommodities which this delay brought$N unto me. And specially, that they think in this$N next month of August, to hold a Parliament against$N me and all my servants. And in the mean time I$N am stayed here, and yet will you that I should put my$N self further into your country (without seeing you)$N and remove me further from mine: and there_to do<p. 248$N me this dishonour at the requests of my rebels, as$N to send commissioners to hear them against me, as$N you would do to a mean subject; and not hear me by$N mouth. Now Madame, I have promised you to come$N to you: and having there made my moan and complaint$N of those rebels, and they coming thither not$N as possessors but as subjects to answer, I would have$N besought you to hear my justification of that which$N they have falsely set forth against me: and if I could$N not purge myself thereof, you might then discharge$N your hands of my causes, and let me go for such as$N I am. But to do as you say, if I were culpable, I$N would be better advised. But being not so, I cannot$N accept this dishonour at their hands, that being in$N possession they will come and accuse me before your$N commissioners, whereof I cannot like. And seeing$N you think it to be against your honour and cousinage$N to do otherwise, I beseech you that you will not be$N mine enemy until you may see how I can discharge$N my_self every way. And to suffer me to go into$N France where I have a dowry to maintain me; or$N at the least to go into Scotland, with assurance that$N if there come any strangers thither, I will bind my_self$N for their return without any prejudice to you.$N Or if it please you not to do thus, I protest that I$N will not impute it to falsehood if I receive strangers$N in my country, without making you any other discharge$N for it. Do with my body at your will, the<p. 249$N honour or blame shall be yours.    For I had rather die$N here, and that my faithful servants may be succoured$N (though you would not so) by strangers, then to$N suffer them to be utterly undone upon h.....  To receive$N in time to come particular commodity.    There$N be many things that move me to fear that I shall$N have to do in this country with other than with you.$N But forasmuch as nothing has followed upon my last$N moan, I hold my peace.    Happen what may happen,$N I have as lief to abide my fortune, as to seek it and$N not find it.   Further, it pleased you to give license$N to my subjects to go and come.    This has been refused$N me by my Lord Scrooge and Mister Knolls (as$N they say) by your commandment, because I would$N not depart hence to your charge until I had answer$N of this letter; though I showed them that you required$N my answer upon the two points contained in$N your letter.  The one is (to let you briefly understand$N them) I am come to you to make my moan to you;$N the which being heard, I would declare unto you mine$N innocence, and then require your aide.   And for lack$N thereof I cannot but make my moan and complaint to$N God, that I am not heard in my just quarrel; and to$N appeal to other princes to have respect thereunto, as$N my case required; and to you Madame first of all,$N when you shall have examined your conscience before$N and have him for witness: and the other, which<p. 250$N is to come further into your country, and not to come$N to your presence : I will esteem that as no favour, but$N will take it for the contrary: obeying it as a thing$N forced.$N In the mean_time I beseech you to return to$N me my Lord Heris, for I cannot be without him,$N having none of my council here; and also to suffer$N me, if it please you, without further delay, to depart$N hence, whither so ever it is, out of this country. I$N am sure you will not deny me this simple request for$N your honour's sake, seeing it does not please you to use$N your natural goodness towards me other ways. And$N seeing that of mine accord I am come hither, let me$N depart again with yours. And if God permit my$N causes to succeed well, I shall be bound to you for it;$N and happening otherwise, yet I cannot blame you.$N As for my lord Flemin, seeing that upon my credit you$N have suffered him to go home to his house, I warrant$N you he shall pass no further, but shall return$N when it shall please you. In that you trust me I$N will not (to die for it) deceive you: but from Donbertran,$N I answer not, when my L. Flemyn shall be in$N the Tower; for they which are within it will not let to$N receive succours, if I do not assure them of yours.$N No, though you would charge me withal. For I have$N left them in charge to have more respect to my servants$N and to mine estate, then to my life,$N Good sister be of an other mind.    Win the<p. 251$N heart, and all shall be yours, and at your commandment.$N I thought to satisfy you wholly, if I might$N have seen you. Alas do not as the serpent that$N stopped his hearing, for I am no enchanter, but your$N sister and natural cousin.    If Cesar had not disdained$N to hear or read the complaint of an advertiser,$N he had not so died.    Why should Prince's$N ears be stopped, seeing they are painted so long;$N meaning that they should hear all, and be well advised$N before they answer.    I am not of the nature of$N the basilisk, and less of the camelions, to turn you$N to my likeness: and though I should be so dangerous$N and cursed as men say, you are sufficiently armed$N with constance, and with justice, which I require of$N God, who give you grace to use it well, with long$N and happy life.

Wherefore I humbly beseech$N your Lordship to take these few lines in good part, which$N I write rather to continue this.     I owe unto you then for$N any other thing they may continue in them. The Emperor as$N I wrote last unto your Lordship has these two years$N continually pretended a journey to Prague, which it is thought$N shall indeed be performed, to the great contentacion of that$N kingdom, which otherwise seemed to bend to disobedience.$N There it is thought his son shall very shortly be king,<p. 99$N whom likewise the Emperor seeks by all means possible to$N advance to the Kingdom of the Romaines, and for that$N purpose desires to call an imperial diet in Frankfort, the$N   appointed for the elections, but it is thought the electors$N will rather choose an other for this next ensuing diet$N which is said shall be summer following at the furthest$N and then there is no hope of election. Not being at Frankfort,$N it is likely it shall at Regensburg, where I believe the$N Emperor will demand far greater sums of money than$N will be granted unto him. Though the peace betwixt the$N Turk and him, as yet as far as it is known perfectly concluded,$N yet it is thought the Turk will rather proceed by$N sea then this way, and as the French ambassador has$N written, means to visit the Pope’s territory, perchance$N his conscience moves him, to seek the benefit of Jubile.$N I hope as the Spaniards already begin to speak lower, so the$N Pope’s holiness will have less leisure to minister such wicked$N and detestable councils to the Christian princes as hitherto$N he does. Out of France your Lordship has the$N advertisements for(?)     the Prince of Conde is retired to Basill$N where he lives in company with the Admiral’s children,$N being frustrate of a great hope he had conceived of suckory/*chickory$N out of Germany wherein many and wise men do impute$N great fault to the Prince Casimire the Count Palatine’s$N second son, in so much that to write to your Lordship$N plainly, he is heavily suspected to be corrupted by the French.$N His father certainly is as virtuous a prince as lives,$N he suffers himself too much to be governed by that son.$N This I thought my duty to write as having heard it in$N very good place and much affected to the true cause.$N The Polaks/*Poles heartily repent their so farfetched election, being$N now in such case    neither they have the King, nor any$N thing the King with so many oaths had promised besides that$N there is lately stirred up a very dangerous sedition, for the same$N cause that has bred such lamentable ruins in France and$N Flanders. Now the     is reasonably well appeased, but it is$N thought it will remain so but a while.$N   I have no other thing worthy the writing at this present to$N your Lordship wherefore I humbly cease with my daily and$N most bound prayer, that it please the Eternal, to continue<p. 100$N and increase you in all prosperity.

Feuillerat, no. 20, pp. 100-102.$N To Lord Burghley:$N   Right honourable and my singular good Lord. Since the$N last I write unto your Lordship, I have not had any$N convenient means of sending my scribbles, which humble$N office I desire to continue, rather to obey therein your commandment$N than for anything worthy to be advertised,$N they may happen to continue in them. Now having opportunity$N by a friend of mine, who presently sends his letters$N into England, I would not omit this occasion, beseeching$N your Lordship rather to respect the hearty desire to please$N you, than the simplicity of the contents, better than which$N your Lordship ought not to expect of me. Being returned$N out of Italy and detained for some time with sickness$N in this city, yet could I not command my desire of seeing$N Poland which time notwithstanding, I might perchance$N have employed in more profitable, at least more pleasant$N voyages, from thence being of late come hither, not in very$N good estate of body, I find the affairs of this court as far$N as I can learn to pass in order. The Emperor has at$N length obtained his long desired truce of the great Turk$N for 8 years, the grant of which he has understood by a$N courier sent by his leger/*light ambassador, called Charles Rym,$N who is now in his returnee/*return not far hence and in his room there$N is already at Constantinople David Ungnad. The conditions$N of the peace are not as yet known, but the Emperor is$N resolute to refuse no burden, rather than enter in war. He$N does expect very shortly the Turkish ambassador, for the$N confirmation of the peace, who is by nation a Dutch man,$N born in Bavier, the Turks principal interpreter, named<p. 101$N among them Mehemet Beck. This courier has brought$N news from Constantinople that the Turks’ navy is safe returned,$N which he will increase the next year with a hundred$N galleys for to invade Sicily. By the way Petro Portocarrero$N Captain of the Gollett is deceased. Serbellone builder and$N captain but evil defender of the new fort is come alive to a$N miserable captivity.$N   He says likewise  that there came to Constantinople advertisement$N that the Belierbei of Egypt has lately overthrown$N In a very great battle, the Abissines subjects to Pretre John$N as we call him. In my simple opinion they have been provoked$N by the Portuguese to take this matter far above their forces$N upon them, for that the Turk by the read sea does greatly$N encroach upon their Indian traffic. The expectation of these$N ambassadors will cause the Emperor to delay his journey to$N Bohemia which notwithstanding he must necessarily ere it$N be long perform they being very evil content, of his so long$N absence, in so much that this year they have plainly refused$N to give certain great sums of money, which heretofore$N they had not denied. Besides that he must please them for to$N get his son the crown for although he do pretend hereditary$N succession thetyseeme/*that it seems they will not grant it any other way$N but in manner of election. In this means time he has sent the$N Lord of Rosemberg a principal nobleman of Bohemia to the$N electors of Sax and Brandenbourg, and the Lord of Arach to$N the other 4 electors, of the Rhine, to consult of an Imperial$N diet, which it is not unlikely shall be this summer following,$N wherein if it be possible, he will persuade the election of his son$N to the kingdom of the Romaines as the term it. The$N Polakes having appeased a great sedition in Crackow for the$N religion, have since defeated twelve thousand Tartars among$N which there were 3000 Turks, whose returnee with far greater$N force they do daily look for. It is thought they will chose an$N other King  in May, although the Lithuanians be holy against$N It. They have made truce with the Moscovit, who bends his$N forces as they say against the King of Sweden for having burnt$N a town of his called Narva.$N   Thus your Lordship may see how bold I am upon your$N commandment to trouble you from your weighty affairs, for$N which craving pardon and good acceptation I humbly cease,<p. 102$N beseeching the Eternal to grant you in health increase of$N all honour.$N   From Wien this 17th of December 1574.$N                Your Lordship’s to command.$N                                  Philip Sidney.$N   To the right honourable and my singular good Lord the$N Lord high Treasurer.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 204<Author(s)/writer(s): Queen Elizabeth I, *1533<Place of author: London<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: 42<Status of author: royal<Recipient: Earl of Shrewsbury<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: cousin and councillor<Relation of correspondents: downwards<Ranks of correspondents: unequal<Exact date: 1575<Century (in quarters): 4/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: London standard<Queen Elizabeth to the Earl of Shrewsbury (1575),<Original Letters, ed.

(1579),<The Works of Edmund Spenser, ed. Greenlaw et al., no. I, pp. 5-8.$N To the Worshipful his very singular$N good friend, Master G.H. Fellow$N of Trinity Hall in Cambridge.$N Good Master G. I perceive by your most courteous and$N      friendly Letters your good will to be no less in$N      deed, than I always esteemed. In recompense$N      whereof, think I beseech you, that I will spare neither$N      speech, nor writing, nor aught else, whenever,$N      and wheresoever occasion shall be offered me: yea,$N      I will not stay, till it be offered, but will seek it,$N in all that possibly I may. And that you may perceive how much$N your Counsel in all things prevail with me, and how altogether$N I am ruled and over-ruled thereby: I am now determined to alter$N mine own former purpose, and to subscribe to your advisement:$N being notwithstanding resolved still, to abide your farther resolution. My$N principal doubts are these. First, I was minded for a while to have intermitted$N the uttering of my writings: least by over-much cloying their noble$N ears, I should gather a contempt of my self, or else seem rather for$N gain and commodity to do it, for some sweetness that I have already$N tasted. Then also me seems the work too base for his excellent Lordship,$N being made in honour of a private personage unknown, which of$N some ill-willers might be upbraided, not to be so worthy, as you know$N she is: or the matter not so weighty, that it should be offered to so weighty$N a personage: or the like. The self former title still likes me well enough,$N and your fine addition no less. if these, and the like doubts, may be$N of importance in your seeming, to frustrate any part of your advice,$N I beseech you, without the least self love of your own purpose, council<p. 6$N me for the best: and the rather do it faithfully, and carefully, for$N that, in all things I attribute so much to your judgement, that I am evermore$N content to annihilate mine own determinations, in respect thereof.$N And indeed for your self to, it sits with you now, to call your wits$N and senses together, (which are always at call) when occasion is so fairly$N offered of estimation and preferment. For, whiles the iron is hot, it is$N good striking, and minds of nobles vary, as their estates. LAT_Verum LAT_ne$N LAT_Quid LAT_durius.$N   I pray you bethink you well hereof, good Master G. and forthwith$N write me those two or three special points and caveats for the nonce,$N LAT_De LAT_quibus LAT_in LAT_superioribus LAT_illis LAT_mellitissimis, LAT_longissimisque LAT_Litteris LAT_tuis.$N Your desire to hear of my late being with her Majesty, must dye in$N it self. As for the two worthy gentlemen, Master Sidney, and Master$N Dyer, they have me, I thank them, in some use of familiarity: of whom,$N and to whom, what speech passes for your credit and estimation,$N I leave your_self to conceive, having always so well conceived of my$N unfained affection, and zeal towards you. And now they have proclaimed$N in their title, a general surceasing and silence of bald$N rhymers, and also of the very best to: in_stead whereof, they have by$N authority of their whole Senate, prescribed certain laws and rules of$N quantities of English syllables, for English verse: having had thereof$N already great practise, and drawn me to their faction. New books$N I hear of none, but only of one, that writing a certain book, called$N The School of Abuse, and dedicating it to Master Sidney, was for his$N labour scorned: if at least it be in the goodness of that nature to scorn.$N Such folly is it, not to regard beforehand the inclination and quality$N of him, to whom we dedicate our books. Such might I happily$N incur, entitling My Slomber, and the other pamphlets, unto his honour.$N I meant them rather to Master Dyer. But I am, of late, more in love$N with my English versifying, than with rhyming: which I should have$N done long since, if I would then have followed your council. LAT_Sed LAT_te$N LAT_solum LAT_iam LAT_tum LAT_suspicabur LAT_cum LAT_Aschamo LAT_sapere: LAT_nunc LAT_Aulam LAT_video LAT_egregios$N LAT_alere LAT_Poetas LAT_Anglicos. Master E.K. heartily desires to be recommended$N unto your worship: of whom, what account he makes,<p. 7$N your self shall hereafter perceive, by his painful and dutiful verses$N of your self.$N   Thus much was written at Westminster yesternight: but coming this$N morning, being the sixteenth of October, to Mistress Kerkes, to have$N it delivered to the Carrier, I received your letter, sent me the last$N week: whereby I perceive you otherwise continue your old exercise of$N versifying in English: which  glory I had now thought should have$N been only ours here at London, and the court.$N   Trust me, your verses I like passingly well, and envy your hidden$N pains in this kind, or rather malign, and grudge at your self, that$N would not once impart so much to me. But once, or twice, you make$N a breach in Master Drant’s Rules: LAT_quod LAT_tamen LAT_condonabimus LAT_tanto$N LAT_Poetae, LAT_tuaeque LAT_ipsius LAT_maximae LAT_in LAT_his LAT_rebus LAT_autoritati. You shall see$N when we meet in London, (which, when it shall be, certify us) how$N fast I have followed after you, in that course: beware, lest in time I$N overtake you. LAT_Verutamen LAT_te LAT_solum LAT_sequar, (LAT_ut LAT_saepenumero` LAT_sum LAT_professus,)$N LAT_nunquam LAT_sane` LAT_assequar, LAT_dum LAT_viuam. And now requite I you$N with the like, not with the very best, but with the very shortest, namely$N with a few iambics: I dare warrant, they be precisely perfect for the$N feet (as you can easily judge) and vary not one inch from the rule.$N I will impart yours to Master Sidney, and Master Dyer, at my next$N going to the court. I pray you, keep mine close to your self, or your$N very entire friends, Master Preston, Master Still, and the rest.$N LAT_Iambicum LAT_trimetrum$N unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy state,$N   make thy self fluttering wings of thy fast flying$N   Thought, and fly forth unto my Love, wheresoever she be:$N whether lying restless in heavy bed, or else$N   sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or else$N   playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.$N If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no rest:$N   If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no meat:$N   If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no mirth.$N Asked why? say: waking love suffers no sleep:<p. 8$N LAT_Plura LAT_vellem LAT_per LAT_Charites, LAT_sed LAT_non LAT_licet LAT_per LAT_Musas.$N LAT_Vale, LAT_Vale LAT_plurimum, LAT_Mi amabilissime LAT_Harueie, LAT_meo LAT_cordi, LAT_meorum$N LAT_omnium long LAT_charissime.$N I was minded also to have sent you some English verses: or rhymes,$N for a farewell: but by my troth, I have no spare time in the world, to$N think on such toys, that you know will demand a freer head, than$N mine is presently. I beseech you by all your courtesies, and graces, let$N me be answered, ere I go: which will be, (I hope I fear, I think) the$N next week, if I can be dispatched of my Lord. I go thither, as sent by$N him, and maintained most what of him: and there am to employ my time,$N my body, my mind, to his Honour’s service. Thus with many superhearty$N Recommendations, and Recommendations to yourself, and all my friends$N with you, I end my last farewell, not thinking any more to write unto$N you, before I go: and withall committing to your faithful credence the$N eternal memory of our everlasting friendship, the inviolable memory$N of our unspotted friendship, the sacred memory of our vowed friendship$N : which I beseech you continue with usual writings, as you may,$N and of all things let me hear some news from you. As gentle M. Sidney,$N I thank his good worship, has required of me, and so promised to do$N again. LAT_Qui LAT_monet, LAT_ut LAT_facias, LAT_quod LAT_iam LAT_facis, you know the rest. You$N may always send them most safely to me by Mistress Kerke, and by none$N other.

I like your late English hexameters so exceedingly well,$N that I also endure my pain sometime in that kind: which I find indeed,$N as I have heard you often defend in word, neither so hard, nor so$N harsh, that it will easily and fairly, yield it self to our mother$N tongue. For the only, or chiefest hardness, which seems, is in the$N accent: which sometime gapes, and as it were yawns illfavouredly,$N coming short of that it should, and sometime exceeding the measure$N of the number, as in Carpenter, the middle syllable being used short in$N speech, when it shall be read long in verse, seems like a lame Gosling,$N that draws one leg after her: and heaven, being used short as one$N syllable, when it is in verse, stretched out with a diastole, is like a lame$N dog that holds up one leg. But it is to be one with custom,$N and rough words must be subdued with use. For, why a God’s name may$N not we, as else the Greeks, have the kingdom of our own language,$N and measure our accents, by the sound, reserving the quantity to the$N verse? Lo here I let you see my old use of toying in rhymes, turned$N Into your artificial straightness of verse, by this Tetrasticon. I beseech$N you tell me your fancy, without partiality.$N   See you the blindfolded pretty God, that feathered archer,$N    Of lovers’ miseries which make his bloody game?$N   Wote/Know you why his mother with a veil has covered his face?$N    Trust me, least he my Love happily chance to behold.$N Seem they comparable to those two, which I translated you LAT_ex LAT_tempore$N In bed, the last time we lay together in Westminster?$N   That which I eat, did I joy, and that which I greedily gorged,$N    As for those many goodly matters left I for others.$N   I would heartily wish, you would either send me the Rules and Precepts$N of Art, which you observe in quantities, or else follow mine, that$N M. Philip Sidney gave me, being the very same which M. Drant devised,$N but enlarged with M. Sidneys own judgement, and augmented with my$N observations, that we might both accord and agree in one: least we$N overthrow one an other, and be overthrown of the rest. Trust me, you$N will hardly believe what great good liking and estimation Master Dyer<p. 17$N had of your satirical verses, and I, since the view thereof, having$N before of my self had special liking of English versifying, am even$N now about to give you some token, what, and owe well therein I am$N able to do: for to tell you truth, I mind shortly at convenient leisure,$N to set forth a book in this kind, which I entitle, Epithalamion$N Thamesis, which book I dare undertake will be very profitable for the$N knowledge, and rare for the invention, and manner of handling. For in$N setting forth the marriage of the Thames: I show his first beginning,$N and offspring, and all the country, that he passes thorough, and also$N describe all the rivers throughout England, which came to this wedding,$N and their right names, and right passage, etc. A work believe$N me, of much labour, wherein notwithstanding Master Holinshed has$N much furthered and advantaged me, who therein has bestowed singular$N pains, in searching out their first heads, and sources: and also in$N tracing, and dogging out all their course, till they fall into the sea.$N                 Lat_O Lat_Tite, LAT_siQuid, LAT_ego,$N                 LAT_EcQuid Lat_erit Lat_pretii?$N   But of that more hereafter.

Her Majesty,$N I see, my Lord, often times does fall into mislike of this cause,$N and sundry opinions it may breed in her with all, but I trust in$N the Lord, seeing her Highness has thus far resolved and grown also$N to this far execution as she has, and that mine and other$N men’s poor lives and substances are adventured for her sake, and$N by her commandment, that she will fortify and maintain her$N own action to the full performance of that she has agreed on.$N Than shall there be no doubt, but assured hope, of all good$N success, to the glory of God and perpetual honour to her Majesty.$N   My good Lord, you may conceive my meaning without more$N words used to you, and the rather for that I desired Mr. Secretary$N to impart a letter to you I wrote to him. I beseech your$N Lordship have this cause even to your heart, as it does appear you$N have done by consenting to the adventure of your eldest son$N with such supply and maintenance as shall be fit, all she has$N done hitherto will be utterly lost and cast away, and we her poor$N subjects no better than objects. And, good my Lord, for my$N last, have me only thus far in your care, that in these things$N which her Majesty and you all have agreed and confirmed for me$N to do, that I be not made a metamorphosis, that I shall not$N know what to do.$N   And so the Lord have you in his keeping, preserve her Majesty$N for ever, and send me good speed in this service. in some haste$N this 5th of December, on my way to the sea side;$N                                 by your Lordship’s assured friend,$N                                                     R Leicester.$N   My Lord, no man feels comfort but they that have cause of<p. 24$N grief, and no men have so much need of relief and comfort$N as those that go in these doubtful services. I pray you, my$N Lord, help us to be kept in comfort, for we will hazard our lives$N for it.<Addressed.$N To the right honourable$N   my very good Lord, the$N   Lord Burley, Lord treasurer$N   of England.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 221<Author(s)/writer(s): Earl of Leicester (1532?-1588)<Place of author: x<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (c53)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Sir Francis Walsyngham<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Mr<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1585<Century (in quarters): 4/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<The Earl of Leicester to Mr. Secretary Walsyngham (1585),<Correspondence of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, ed. Bruce,<Letter 19, pp. 46-49.$N   Mr secretary, I came hither to the Hay, upon Monday last,$N where I was very honourably received, all the states being assembled$N together for that purpose, to make as much shew as they$N could devise of their good wills to her Majesty, as in many orations,$N pageants, and such like, was expressed, beside the people$N with great joy cried, " God save the Queen, God save the$N Queen," in every place of the streets as I passed.$N   The next day all the whole states general came to me, and there$N openly again there Chancellor Leonius (some call him Longonius)$N made a long oration in thanks and praises to the Queen’s Majesty$N for her great clemency, bounty, and goodness, showed to$N these poor afflicted countries; attributing all their good and happiness,$N under God, to her Majesty only. As soon as he had done$N than came commissioners from particular provinces, as from Utrecht,$N Geldars, and Fresland, besides sundry special towns, as Amsterdam,$N Leiden, Auchuson, and others, all which must needs use$N there gratulation, with orations, as the other deed, and much to$N the same effect all with thanks and praise to her Majesty.<p. 47$N   At all this ceremonydoing was there a French secretary, sent$N hither 5 or 6 days before with letters from the King. He said$N it was about merchants matters, but in deed contrary, only to$N have impeached, if he could, this bending themselves to her$N majesty as they do. But the states gave him no audience all$N the while, alleging they were occupied about the service of the$N Queen of England, which they would dispatch before all princes in$N the world. This fellow, being present at all this solemn dealing$N with me, took it in such snuff as he came proudly to the states,$N and offered his letters, saying: "Now I trust you have done all your$N sacrifices to the Queen of England, and may yield me some leisure$N to read my masters letters." They so shook him up, and$N with such terms, naming her Majesty in scorn, as they took it,$N as they hurled him his letters, and bid him content himself,$N they would first discharge all the least duties whatsoever to her$N majesty before they would hear him. So they have every day since$N set about the contract with her Majesty, specially how to give$N me answer for her full satisfaction touching there ability to$N maintain there wars, wherein I hear credibly her Majesty shall be$N well satisfied, and further then any of us looked for. And both$N roundly and frankly they go to work, that you shall see they$N will do indeed more than ever they promised, considering her$N Majesty’s denial of the sovereignty and name of protector.$N For they mean, and must do it, for the whole people will have$N it, that her Majesty shall have in her hands the whole bestowing$N as well of there money and contributions as of there men of war;$N and the desire no longer her good favour to them than they shall$N deal in all sincerity with her. Wherein it appears that all the$N commissioners have wonderfully set fourth her Majesty to them$N all here, and Paul Buys has done his part thoroughly, so has$N Walk also. And all things already are carried on with the most$N universal obedience of her Majesty’s name that ever I saw. And<p. 48$N flatly it appears now, they will no other authority but under$N her Majesty, nor that heir treasure nor lives shall be at the disposing$N of any but her Majesty, which, if you saw that we see here,$N you would wonder at what these people do, and are able to do,$N and if God had not moved her Majesty to send when she did,$N the prince of Parma had been by this time in the best and greatest$N towns they have; but you shall hear others in this and not me.$N   And as I wrote before how her Majesty’s dealings here are$N already blown into Germany, so this day the elector brought me$N letters again newly come there, whereby they write most honourably$N of her Majesty, and the Duke of Sax gives much better eye$N than he did, since his wife’s death, and like to marry again with$N the house of Hanalt, a great protestant and a great house. He$N has sent to speak with Seiguro, and very like to join with the$N other princes, who are agreed, not only to send a messenger to the$N French King, but to let him now, that they will come to the aid$N of the King of Navare, who is most enviously dealt withal$N by the practice of the pope and King of Spain. The elector$N vowed to me that they have done more in these  causes within$N this 20 days, since they understood of her Majesty’s resolution$N against the King of Spain, as well by Sir Francis Drakes going$N into the Indies as her sending into these countries, than they$N have don this 10 years, or would have don this twelvemonths yet. God$N send her Majesty to think of his merciful dealings accordingly.$N The King of Denmark also has joined and encouraged greatly$N these princes. It is told me by the elector that divers of them$N mean to send hither to me, to congratulate her Majesty’s gracious$N doings toward his country.$N   I have no other nuesytull these states have fully ended their$N consultations, which will be to morrow, as I hear, and wholly, without$N contradiction, to be at the devotion and disposition of her<p. 49$N majesty absolutely. Of this you shall hear as soon as I shall know$N there further answer. Two of our men of war of Flushing has$N taken 2 Dunkirk men; one sank and drowned all the soldiers$N and mariners. Thus fare you well, sir, this last of December.$N                                      Your assured friend,$N                                           R.

Some her Majesty did set down, as I take it,$N above 70000 pounds. So you will procure, as much as in you may lye,$N that the most part may be sent over. It shall be the worst, and$N the most, she shall be charged with, but, at the beginning, 20000 pounds.$N shall stand in more stead than 40000 pounds. 4 months hence, and I am$N well persuaded, as you shall see at Mr Davyson’s coming, that they$N here have good means to maintain there wars, and when we$N make reckoning at home of a defensible war, it must be so defensible,$N as we must be able to have always 6 or 70000 men, horse$N and footmen, to front the enemy, who, all this hard weather, has$N gone from place to place with 4000 footmen and 1500 horse, and at$N this day he keeps the field, and has put in danger 3 or 4 towns$N of great importance, as Brabe, Wenloe, Vianna, and Bomeley, as$N also now he is come upon Zeland side, and will do what he$N can to Lylle and Lyskinshook, where there has been much decay$N of soldier, but there is doing all that is possible for defence, for$N otherwise we are no way able to resist them, which they know,<p. 65$N and does make them presume the more at this time. But the$N states have agreed, and do find there is no remedy, but we must$N erect a camp to bridle this liberty of the enemy, or else he will$N keep a war this 20 year, and make us all weary, and, this way$N being taken, I warrant you we will shortly weary him as well, and$N yet never hazard any battle, which he will be as loath to come to$N as we.$N   I am in hope of an enterprise to take place shortly which you$N will be glad to hear of. God send it to fall out as I look for,$N and that you may provide us speedily with a good some of money,$N being all one to her Majesty, and I will undertake she shall come$N to no further charge whatsoever. I will help to ease her, before$N the end, of a  good part of this, if she do but continue her favour$N and good countenance to this cause only, as I trust she will,$N or else she knows not the lack she will find of the friendship$N of these countries.

I would to God your Lordship's health$N and strength were answerable to your mind; then I$N am sure this company here with me should be happy$N to see your Lordship here.$N    My Lord, on Wednesday last I went to Harwich$N to see the town and the haven, which I had not seen$N this 27 years. My Lord, it is a place to be made$N much of, for the haven has not his fellow in all$N respects  not in this realm, and specially as long as$N we have such enemies so near us as they be in the$N Low Countries, and not more assured than we are$N of Scotland. My Lord, we can bring all the ships$N that her Majesty has, aground there in 3 springs.$N I know not that we can do so in any place else but$N here at Chatham. That which is adoing above the$N town will be to very good purpose for any sudden$N attack, and for my part I wish it were as strong as$N Flushing.$N    I received a letter from my Lord Cobham, of an$N enterprise that is sent down to burn all such ships of$N her Majesty's as shall ride before the Rammekens$N or thereabouts. I received this letter as I was half$N the way coming homewards from Harwich. I$N presently sent away a pinnace, with John Wynter in$N her, your Lordship's servant, and did send the$N advertisement unto Sir William Russell, with a letter<p. 46$N of my own; and likewise I did write unto the$N captains of her Majesty's ships, with certain instructions,$N which, if the device be attempted, I$N believe you shall hear they shall smart for their$N device. There is two ships and a pinnace: their$N victuals comes out about an eight days hence, so$N that then they will come away. In the meantime,$N if nothing be done already, I doubt not but they$N shall safely come away. My good Lord, God send$N you ever well to do: and so I bid your Lordship$N most heartily farewell.

But this I am sure of ; if her$N Majesty would have spent but a 1,000 crowns to$N have had some intelligence, it would have saved$N her twenty times as much. Assure yourself he$N knows what we do here; and if the army be or$N do dissolve, it is the preparation that her Majesty<p. 47$N has made that is the cause; for he cannot abide$N this heat that is provided for him. He did never$N think that he would thus have provided for his$N coming, but that the number of false alarums that$N he has given her Majesty would have made her to$N have taken no alarum, and so to have had the$N vantage; and the chopping up of his friends here I$N am sure he does not like; and if they be up, I wish$N they should continue so till there be a good peace,$N which I pray to God to send us.$N    Sir, if your next advertisements do assure the$N dissolving of the army in Spain, then it were good$N we did so here; yet if the Duke of Parma continue$N his, and that there be any doubt of anything$N intended for Scotland, put but three or four more$N ships to them in the Narrow Seas and I dare assure$N you it shall beat any power he shall be able to make,$N and impeach him of any attempt in Scotland; and$N I will take upon me the service myself; for I assure$N you it does grieve me to see her Majesty at more$N charges than is needful, and this charge will not be$N great. I would fain keep the Narrow Seas three$N or four months; I persuade myself I shall do some$N service.$N    Upon your next advertisement, as the cause upon$N that shall require, I will write to you, Sir, my good$N friend, my opinion, and then you may use it as you$N shall think best. And so I pray you to write me$N frankly; for I do assure you I will take it kindly$N and friendly at your hands, and think myself much$N beholden unto you for it; for I may sometimes,$N upon a good conceit in my opinion, make such a$N journey as I did now to Harwich; and yet it may$N not be so well taken there; but I know no cause<p. 48$N why it should be but well taken. I do assure you,$N on my honour, it cost not the Queen's Majesty one$N halfpenny, nor shall not, when I make any such$N journey. I will rather spend myself one hundred$N pounds than to spend her one penny.

If it were not for you$N I should live in a dead place for hearing of anything.$N    Touching Sir Francis Drake, I have likewise$N received a letter from him with the like advertisement.$N There happened a mischance in one of his$N ships at Portsmouth, that a piece broke and killed a$N man, with some other hurt. If you would write a$N word or two unto him to spare his powder, it would$N do well.$N    Sir, I send you herewith enclosed all the copies$N of the letters from my Lord Chamberlain again,$N which I most heartily thank you for, and I pray to$N God the Scottish King do deceive me, but I am$N afraid he will not. For my own part, I have made$N of the French King, the Scottish King, and the<p. 49$N King of Spain, a Trinity that I mean never to trust$N to be saved by; and I would others were, in that, of$N my opinion.$N    Sir, there was never, since England was England,$N such a stratagem and mask made to deceive England$N withal as this is of the treaty of peace. I pray$N God we have not cause to remember one thing that$N was made of the Scots by the Englishmen; that we$N do not curse for this a long grey beard with a white$N head, witless, that will make all the world think us$N heartless. You know whom I mean.$N    I have received a letter from Sir Henry Palmer,$N that there is at Dunkirk divers hoys and lighters,$N that be filled with ballast and great stones, surely$N means for the stopping of some haven. I will$N have a watch on them.$N    I pray you, Sir, send me word when you think$N the Commissioners will be sent over, that I may$N have all things ready for them; and I pray you let$N me know if any go in Sir Amyas Poulet's place;$N for if he be able to go himself, if I may know of it,$N will have especial care of him, that he may go at$N ease.<p. 50$N    Sir, if there be at any time any matter of$N importance wherein I may do any service there with$N you, I can be quickly there and here again.$N    I pray you, Sir, let it be thought on, as you see$N cause upon your advertisements, it will ask a good$N time to furnish our fleet again with men as they$N were. I do not look to see it ever bettered. I$N pray God it be as well when there shall be cause.$N And so giving you most hearty thanks for your$N most friendly dealing with me in all causes, and$N your friendly remembrance, I bid you most heartily$N farewell.

If he had been here I would$N have sent him unto you; but he is extreme sick at$N London, and, as I do understand, in some danger;$N which I am very  sorry for, for he is a tall gentleman.$N He has the charge of all my soldiers in my$N ship, and has done his duty very well. I hope he$N will answer all honestly and well.$N    Sir, if the commissioners be once gone over$N and that there be a surcease of arms, it shall be but$N folly and to no purpose for me to lie here. I think$N both I and the noblemen, leaving sufficient lieutenants$N in our ships, and the officers, as Sir W.<p. 51$N Wynter, Mr. Hawkyns and Mr. Borough, remain$N here with the navy will be sufficient; for before$N these ships can have their full number of men again$N it will be a month to gather them, do what we can.$N And I pray to God we have them when we shall$N need; for many are gone abroad, and specially the$N chiefest men; God send me to see such a company$N together again when need is. I protest it before$N God I write not this to you because I am weary$N with being here; for if it were not for her Majesty's$N presence I had rather live in the company of these$N noble ships than in any place. And yet would I be$N glad that there were something to do. I am more$N sorrier for the noblemen than any ways for myself;$N for I would have them save, to spend when need$N shall be. I do assure you they live here bountifully,$N and it will be hard finding of such noblemen as$N these be, so well affected to this service and that$N will love the sea so well as they do.$N    Sir, if you think that my continuing here with$N the navy serve to good purpose, I shall like well of$N it; but methinks if there be a surcease of arms, then$N my lying here will make a jest to many, and they$N have reason. I think it will be a most fittest time$N to ground our ships in, for now, at our coming out,$N it was you know on such a sudden as we could not$N ground but two or three of the middle sort, so as the$N great ships were not grounded. I have, with the$N advice of the officers and masters, thought good to$N begin with some the next spring, and so in a three$N springs dispatch them all, and have them all in most$N excellent order by the midst of March, all save the<p. 52$N men; and I doubt not but the ships shall prove$N some notable liars, and if cause fall out, do a better$N day of service for England than ever ships did for it$N yet. But this assure yourself if the forces of Spain$N do come before the midst of April, there will be as$N much ado to have men to furnish us, as ever was;$N but men must have, or else the ships will do no$N good. God knows it is but a bare sight to see us$N now to that it was, and I would not wish any to take$N the pains to come to see us till  we are newly supplied,$N when cause shall be. Sir, God send you well$N to do, and continuance of your health, and so I bid$N you most heartily farewell. From aboard her$N Majesty's good ship the Bear, the 28th of January.$N                  Your assured loving friend,$N                                    C.

I will$N acknowledge it with all my love, and ready to do$N you any service.$N   For Mr. Hawkyns' bargain: he is presently to$N repair to the Court, where he shall be best able to$N answer in his own defence; but this much I will say$N to your Lordship: I have been aboard of every$N ship that goes out with me, and in every place$N where any may creep, and I do thank God that they$N be in the estate they be in; and there is never a one$N of them that knows what a leak means. I have known$N when an admiral of England has gone out, and two$N ships in fleet could not say so. There is none that$N goes out now but I durst go to the Rio de la Plata$N in her; and yet the Mary Rose and the Swallow$N be with me, who were ships in the King's Majesty's$N her father's time. And therefore I dare presume<p. 80$N greatly that those that have been made in her$N Majesty's time be very good and serviceable, and$N shall prove them arrant liars that have reported the$N contrary. And I thank God her Majesty, I hope,$N may be well assured of their goodness; yet everything$N has his time, and must be helped as need$N requires.$N   My Lord, I had no meaning to carry away all$N the officers. I have none with me but Sir W.$N Wynter. I leave Mr. Hawkyns and Mr. Borough$N behind to wait on your Lordship, and to put the$N four great ships in readiness, which we shall greatly$N need if the Spanish forces come out. And so, my$N Lord, having no more leisure to write at large,$N being under sail, I bid your Lordship most heartily$N farewell. the 21st of February, at 12 o'clock the$N afternoon.$N   Your Lordship's most assured to command,$N                                      C.

On Friday last, upon good consideration,$N we left the army of Spain so far to the northwards$N as they could neither recover England nor Scotland.$N And within three days after, we were entertained$N with a great storm, considering the time of the year;$N the which storm, in many of your judgements, has$N not a little annoyed the enemy's army.

If your Majesty thought it meet,$N it would not be amiss you sent presently to Denmark$N to understand the truth, and to deal with their$N King according to your Majesty's great wisdom.$N    I have not written this whereby your Majesty$N should diminish any of your forces. Your Highness's$N enemies are many; yet God has and will hear$N your Majesty's prayers, putting your hand to the$N plough for the defence of his truth, as your Majesty$N has begun.

Laughton, vol. II, pp. 97-100.--$N    Most Honourable:  The army of Spain I think$N certainly to be put either with Norway or Denmark.$N There are divers causes which moves me so to$N think. The first, we understand by divers prisoners$N which we have taken, that generally, through all$N their whole fleet, there was no one ship free of sick$N people. Secondly, their ships, masts, sails and$N ropes were very much decayed and spoiled by our<p. 98$N great shot. Thirdly, at Calais, by fire, we forced$N them to cut many of their cables, whereby they lost$N many of their anchors, which of necessity they must$N seek to supply. Further, if they had had none of$N these former great causes of distress, yet the winds$N and storm, with the wind westerly, as it was, has$N forced them thither. And I assure myself that$N whenever her Majesty shall hear of their arrival$N in any of these coasts, that her Highness shall be$N advertised both of their great distress and of no$N small loss amongst them; for I assure your Honour,$N her Majesty's good ships felt much of that storm,$N and lost many of their boats and pinnaces, with$N some anchors and cables; yet were we fair by our$N own shore and the wind right off the land.$N   Some amongst us will not let to say that they$N are in Scotland. I cannot think so, for that we had$N no wind whereby they were able to recover any$N place of the mainland of Scotland; without it were$N some of the out isles, which are no meet places to$N relieve their so many great wants. Norway, or the$N out isles of Scotland, can relieve them but with$N water and a few cows, or bad beef, and some small$N quantity of goats and hens, which is to them as$N nothing. And yet these bad reliefs are to be had$N but in few places, and their roads dangerous.$N    The only thing which is to be looked for is, that$N if they should go to the King of Denmark, and$N there have his friendship and help for all their reliefs,$N none can better help their wants in all these$N parts than he; for that he is a Prince of great$N shipping, and can best supply his wants which now$N the Duke of Medina the Sidonia stands in need$N of, as great anchors, cables, masts, ropes and victuals;$N and what the King of Spain's hot crowns will do in<p. 99$N cold countries for mariners and men, I leave to your$N good Lordship, which can best judge thereof.$N    We left a pinnace of her Majesty's, the Advice,$N and a fine caravel of my own to attend the fleet of$N Spain, when we left them; but what is become of$N them in that great storm, or whether they may be$N stayed in any other country, as they may, I know$N not. My poor opinion is, that it were most meet to$N send a good ship and some fine bark, with some$N very sufficient person, to deal effectually from her$N Majesty with the King of Denmark, as he shall find$N the cause to require; and to send the true report$N back with all speed possible, that they may be the$N better prevented; for no doubt but that which they$N are able to do they will presently put it in execution.$N The winter will overtake them else in those parts.$N If they stay in the sound this winter, I hope many$N of the Spaniards will seek Spain by land.$N    The Prince of Parma, I take him to be as a bear$N robbed of her whelps; and no doubt but, being so$N great a soldier as he is, that he will presently, if he$N may, undertake some great matter; for his rest will$N stand now thereupon. It is for certain that the$N Duke of sidonia stands somewhat jealous of him,$N and the Spaniards begin to hate him, their honour--$N being touched so near; many of their lives spentI$N assure your Honour not so little as five thousand$N men less than when first we saw them near Plymouth--divers of their ships sunk and taken; and$N they have nothing to say for themselves in excuse,$N but that they came to the place appointed, which$N was at Calais, and there stayed the Duke of Parma's$N coming above 24 hours, you, and until they were$N fired thence.$N    So this is my poor conclusion. If we may recover$N near Dunkirk this night or to-morrow morning,<p. 100$N so as their power may see us returned from the$N chase, and ready to encounter them if they once$N sally, that the next news you shall hear will be the$N one to mutiny against the other; which when that$N shall come to pass, or whether they mutiny or no,$N let us all, with one consent, both high and low,$N magnify and praise our most gracious and merciful$N God for his infinite and unspeakable goodness towards$N us; which I protest to your good Lordships$N that my belief is that our most gracious Sovereign,$N her poor subjects, and the Church of God has$N opened the heavens in divers places, and pierced$N the ears of our most merciful father, unto whom, in$N Christ Jesu, be all honour and glory. so be it;$N Amen, Amen.$N    Written with much haste, for that we are ready$N to set sail to prevent the Duke of Parma this$N southerly wind, if it please God; for truly my poor$N opinion is that we should have a great eye unto him.$N From her Majesty's very good ship the Revenge,$N this 10th of August, 1588.$N         Your Honour's faithfully to be$N                         commanded always,$N                                          FRA. DRAKE.$N    For that we were very near to set sail, I most$N humbly beseech your Honour to pardon my pen, for$N that I am forced to write the very copy of that letter$N which I have sent to my Lord Chancellor. Since$N the writing hereof, I have spoken with an Englishman$N which came from Dunkirk yesterday, who says$N upon his life there is no fear of the fleet. Yet would$N I willingly see it.

Laughton, vol. II, pp. 146-149.--$N    Right Honourable:  The uncertainty of the$N reports which daily come unto us out of Calais,$N Dunkirk, Ostend, Flushing, from my Lord of Huntingdon,$N Scotland, and such ships and pinnaces$N which have been sent out for discovery by my Lord$N Admiral, make me rather to rest upon mine own<p. 147$N conjecture than upon any of them, they disagreeing$N so much as they do; the one affirming that the$N Duke of Sidonia, with his fleet, is coming back again,$N that the Duke of Parma is marching presently to$N embark to be conducted by him; the other affirming$N that it is for certain that the fleet of Spain is$N past without Scotland for their way homewards.$N Which reports are quite contrary.$N    My poor opinion is, that if their fleet chance to$N return, it is altogether for that the wind will not$N permit them good passage to go about the other way$N at this time of the year, because it is most subject to$N westerly winds. This wind that now blows, if it$N be not more easterly there than it is here, could$N hardly permit such a fleet, for that they shall feel a$N great wind, for to set sail to pass on the back side of$N Scotland and Ireland, which may be the cause that of$N necessity they must be forced this way for Spain.$N    Farther, my judgement is that the Duke of$N Siding, with his fleet, shall needs jump with fair$N weather, the highest of a spring, with good wind,$N and the Duke of Parma embarking all in one day.$N This were very meet for them; for if any one of these$N fail them, they shall never perform as much as they$N have promised to the King, their master. My$N reason is this. The most part of the ships of the$N Duke of Parma are small, and, being pestered with$N men of war, must of necessity have fair weather; and----$N-- as I am credibly given to understand -- they must$N have a spring to bring their shipping both out of$N Dunkirk, Nieuport, and Sluys.$N   Now, for the Duke of medina his fleet, there is$N no harbour for them upon that coast, so that to$N stir it requires fair weather; which, when it happen$N that we should find there, he is like, God willing,$N to have unquiet rest. And yet, with my consent,<p. 148$N we ought much more to  have regard unto the Duke$N of Parma and his soldiers than to the Duke of$N Siding and his ships, for that our sands will take a$N strong party with us against his great ships, under$N water. My poor opinion is that the Duke of Parma$N should be vigilantly looked upon for these 20 days,$N although the army of Spain return not this way; for$N of them I have no great doubt, although there be$N great cause for us all to watch carefully and defend$N mightily those many and proud enemies which seek$N to supplant the most honourable crown of England$N from our most gracious Sovereign, whom God defend,$N as he has most graciously done for his great$N mercy's sake.$N    I would advertise your Honour of some defects$N in her Majesty's army, but that my very good Lord,$N the Lord Admiral, has written unto your Honour$N thereof at large.$N    This is my poor opinion of her Majesty's army,$N that the threatening of the enemy will put a great$N part of their weakness from her Majesty's good$N subjects, and no doubt but they will fight valiantly.$N although  I find my Lord Admiral well affected,$N when fair weather is, to go for the coast of Flanders,$N yet I would your Honour should animate us forward;$N for there are many causes that might move$N us to be there more than we are, and much better$N for us, and better service. Thus humbly taking$N my leave of your Honour, I rest desiring God to$N give us all grace to live in his fear, so shall we not$N need greatly to fear the enemy. From aboard her$N Majesty's very good ship the Revenge, this 23rd of$N August, 1588.$N    Your Honour's most willing to be commanded,$N                                     FRA. DRAKE.<p. 149$N    I have sent to your Honour a copy, Englished,$N out of a letter sent from Don Pedro de Valdes to the$N King his master, which does deliver the time of$N their victualling, and of some discontentment which$N was between the Duke and him.$N    Let me humbly beseech your Honour that we$N may be put in mind here that it were good we saw$N the coast of Flanders as often as we might.

G. wishes a better exercise, and wisdom to prevent his$N extremities.$N    If woeful experience may move you, gentlemen, to beware, or unheardof$N wretchedness entreat you to take heed, I doubt not but you will look back with$N sorrow on your time past, and endeavour with repentance to spend that which is to$N come. Wonder not (for with the will I first begin), thou famous gracer$N of tragedians, that Green who has said with the, like the fool in his heart,$N "There is no God", should now give glory unto his greatness; for penetrating$N in his power, his hand lies heavy upon me, he has spoken unto me with a$N voice of thunder, and I have felt he is a God that can punish enemies. Why$N should thy excellent wit, his gift, be so blinded that thou should give no glory to$N the giver? Is it pestilent Machiavellian policy that thou haste studied; O peevish$N folly! what are his rules but mere confused mockeries, able to extirpate in small$N time the generation of mankind? for if LAT_sic LAT_volo, LAT_sic LAT_iubeo, hold in those that are able$N to command, and if it be lawful LAT_fas LAT_et LAT_nefas, to do any thing that is beneficial,$N only truants should possess the earth, and they, striving to exceed in tyranny,$N should each to other be a slaughterman, till, the mightiest outliving all, one stroke$N were left for death, that in one age man’s life should end. The broacher of this$N diabolical atheism is dead, and in his life had never the felicity he aimed at, but,$N as he began in craft, lived in fear, and ended in despair. LAT_Quam LAT_inscrutabilia LAT_sunt$N LAT_Dei LAT_iudicia! This murderer of many brethren had his conscience seared like Cayne;$N this betrayer of him that gave his life for him inherited the portion of Judas; this$N apostate perished as ill as Julian: and wilt thou, my friend, be his disciple; look$N unto me, by him persuaded to that liberty, and thou shall find it an infernal$N bondage. I know the least of my demerits merit this miserable death; but wilful$N striving against known truth exceeds all the terrors of my soul. Defer not,$N with me, till this last point of extremity; for little knows thou how in the end$N thou shall be visited.<p. 60$N    With you I join young Juvenal, that biting satirist, that lastly with me$N together writ a comedy. Sweet boy, might I advise the, be advised, and get not$N many enemies by bitter words: inveigh against vain men, for thou can’t do it, no$N man better, no man so well; thou haste a liberty to reprove all and name none:$N for one being spoken to, all are offended,  none being blamed, no man is injured.$N Stop shallow water still running, it will rage; tread on a worm, and it will turn;$N then blame not scholars who are vexed with sharp and bitter lines, if they reprove$N thy too much liberty of reproof.$N    And thou no less desiring then the other two, in some things rarer, in$N nothing inferior, driven, as myself, to extreme shifts, a little have I to say to$N the; and, were it not an idolatrous oath, I would swear by sweet S. George, thou$N art unworthy better hap, since thou depend on so mean a stay. Baseminded$N men all three of you, if by my misery you be not warned; for unto none of you,$N like me, sought those burs to cleave; those puppets, I mean, that speak from our$N mouths, those antics garnished in our colours. Is it not strange that I to whom$N they all have been beholding, is it not like that you to whom they all have$N been beholding, shall, were you in that case that I am now, be both of$N them at once forsaken? Yes, trust them not; for there is an upstart crow <p. 61$N beautified with our feathers, that, with his tiger’s heart wrapped in a player’s hide,$N supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank-verse as the best of you; and$N being an absolute Iohannesscene$N in a country. Oh, that I might entreat your rare wits to be employed in more$N profitable courses, and let these apes imitate your past excellence, and never more$N acquaint them with your admired inventions! I know the best husband of you$N all will never prove an usurer, and the kindest of them all will never prove a kind$N nurse: yet, whilst you may, seek your better masters; for it is pity men of such$N rare wits should be subject to the pleasures of such rude grooms.$N    In this I might insert two more that both have write against these buckram$N gentlemen: but let their own work serve to witness against their own wickedness,$N if they persevere to maintain any more such peasants. For other new$N comers, I leave them to the mercy of these painted monsters, who, I doubt not,$N will drive the bestminded to despise them: for the rest, it skills not though they$N make a ieast at them.$N    But now returnee I again to you three, knowing my misery is to you no news;$N and let me heartily entreat you to be warned by my harms. Delight not, as I$N have done, in irreligious oaths, for from the blasphemers house a curse shall not$N depart. Despise drunkenness, which wastes the wit, and makes men all equal$N unto beasts. Fly lust, as the deathsman of the soul, and defile not the temple of<p. 62$N the Holy Ghost. Abhor those epicures whose loose life has made religion loathsome$N to your ears; and when they soothe you with terms of mastership, remember$N Robert Greene, whom they have often so flattered, perishes now for want of comfort.$N Remember, gentlemen, your lives are like so many light tapers, that are with care$N delivered to all of you to maintain: these with windpuft wrath may be extinguished,$N with drunkenness put out, with negligence let fall; for man’s time of$N itselfe is not so short but it is more shortened by sin. The fire of my life is now$N at the last snuff, and the want of wherewith to sustain it, there is no substance for$N life to feed on. Trust not, then, I beseech you, left to such weak stays; for they$N are as changeable in mind as in many attires. Well, my hand is tired, and I am$N forced to leave where I would begin; for a whole book cannot contain their$N wrongs, which I am forced to knit up in some few lines of words.$N       Desirous that you should live, though himself be dying,$N                                                        ROBERT GREEENE.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 236<Author(s)/writer(s): Robert Greene (1558?-1592)<Place of author: London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: -40 (34)<Status of author: poet<Recipient: wife<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: other<Relation of correspondents: husband to wife<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1592<Century (in quarters): 4/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Greene to his wife (1592),<The Dramatic and Poetical Works of Robert Greene, ed. Dyce, pp. 62-63.$N       A Letter written to his wife, found with this book after his death.$N    The remembrance of many wrongs offered thee, and thy unreproved virtues,$N add greater sorrow to my miserable state than I can utter or thou conceive.$N Neither is it lessened by consideration of thy absence (though shame would let me$N hardly behold thy face), but exceedingly aggravated for that I cannot (as I ought) to$N thy own self reconcile myself, that thou might witness my inward woe at this$N instant, that have made thee a woeful wife for so long a time. But equal heaven$N has denied that comfort, giving, at my last need, like succour as I have sought all$N my life: being in this extremity as void of help as thou has been of hope.$N Reason would that, after so long waste, I should not send thee a child to bring thee$N greater charge: but consider he is the fruit of thy womb, in whose face regard not$N the fathers so much as thy own perfection. He is yet Greene, and may grow$N straight, if he is carefully tended: otherwise apt enough (I fear me) to follow his$N father’s folly. That I have offended thee highly, I know; that thou can forget<p. 63$N my injuries, I hardly believe: yet persuade I my self, if thou saw my wretched$N estate, thou could not but lament it; nay, certainly I know thou would. All$N my wrongs muster themselves about me; every evil at once plagues me. For my$N contempt of God I am condemned of men; for my swearing and forswearing no man$N will believe me; for my gluttony I suffer hunger; for my drunkenness, thirst; for$N my adultery, ulcerous sores/*wounds. Thus God has cast me down, that I might be$N humbled, and punished me for example of others’ sin; and although he suffers me$N in this world to perish without succour, yet trust I in the world to come to find$N mercy, by the merits of my Saviour, to whom I commend you and commit my soul.$N                          Thy repentant husband$N                                 for his disloyalty,$N                                           Robert Greene.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 237<Author(s)/writer(s): Elizabeth Lady Russel (1528-1609)<Place of author: x<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: 40+ (66)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: wife<PLace of recipient: Windsor<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: my Lord; your Lordship; you<Relation of correspondents: aunt to nephew<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1594<Century (in quarters): 4/16<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<Elisabeth dowager Lady Russel to Lord Cecil (1594),<Original Letters, ed.

The memory of friends (I mean$N only for letters) neither enters ordinarily into busied men,$N because they are ever employed within, nor into men of$N pleasure, because they are never at home.

Wotton is, under the oppression of business, or the$N necessity of seeming so; or more than he, because I hope$N you have both pleasure and business: only to me, who have$N neither, this omission were sin; for though writing be not$N of the precepts of friendship, but of the counsels, yet, as in$N some cases to some men counsels become precepts, and$N though not immediately from God, yet very roundly and$N quickly from His Church (as selling and dividing goods$N in the first time, continence in the Roman Church, and$N order in decency in ours), so to me who can do nothing<p. 171$N else, it seems to bind my conscience to write; and it is sin$N to do against the conscience, though that err.$N    "Yet no man's letters might be better wanted than$N mine, since my whole letter is nothing else but a confession$N that I should and would write. I owed you a letter in$N verse before by mine own promise, and now that you think$N that you have hedged in that debt by a greater by your$N letter in verse, I think it now most seasonable and fashionable$N for me to break. At least, to write presently, were to$N accuse myself of not having read yours so often as such a$N letter deserves from you to me.$N   "To make my debt greater (for such is the desire of$N all, who cannot or mean not to pay) I pray read these two$N problems: for such light flashes as these have been my$N hawkings in my Surrey journeys. I accompany them with$N another rag of verses, worthy of that name for the smallness,$N and age, for it has long lain among my other papers,$N and laughs at them that have adventured to you: for I$N think till now you saw it not, and neither you nor it should$N repent it.

I will send by the next messenger$N what D. Lake has done. Thus in haste I could wish I might$N carry Mr. Pembrug Cloakebagge so that I might but come$N by the door and see you.

My Lord Mounteagle and my$N Lord Chandos are very shortly going to the spa,$N though not together; for my Lord Mounteagle is$N grown so in love with a plentiful fortune and a$N private enjoying thereof, as he shuns all other conversation.$N When they are gone there will scarce$N be a gentleman to be seen about this town,$N whence I shall not stir till after Midsummer$N term. Out of Scotland I hear no news but that$N the English of quality are very kindly and royally$N entertained by the nobility, but the meaner sort$N not so well used by the common people; which$N troubles the King extremely, who entertains all the$N noblemen went with him not as servants but$N guests. This is all his journey has yet brought$N forth. By the next you can send to London by,$N let me know when you look you, that I may not$N appoint to come to you at an unseasonable time;$N and I beseech you be more confident in my love$N to you than to suspect the declination thereof$N upon the omission of any ceremony, which I confess$N I am often guilty of towards my friends,$N though never willingly of any such neglect as may<p. 46$N give them a just cause to suspect me; which you$N shall never have, but all the proofs in my power$N that I am as much as you can wish, or is in me$N to be to any,$N Your most faithful and affectionate friend,$N LADY BEDFORD.$N I am very glad to hear by Missis Kendrick that$N your children are so well.

Let my best wishes$N be remembered to Mister Bacon as I make them for$N him, and give me leave to entreat you to do$N me the favour to let some servant of yours carry the$N ten pieces I have delivered this bearer to Norwich,$N whence I have had two letters lately from$N the fine Mister Russell, who it seems the fair Queen$N has forsaken, for he writes me word he is there$N prisoner, in the under_sheriff's house, in great$N necessity; and it were a great pity so complete$N a fool should starve, yet I am loath to send on$N purpose so far to his worship.$N Harington House, this 26th of May [1617].$N To my dear and worthy friend the Lady Cornwallis.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 293<Author(s)/writer(s): Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford (1581-1627)<Place of author: Bedford House, London<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: -40 (36)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Jane Lady Cornwallis<PLace of recipient: Broome, Norfolk<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: you; dear Madam<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1617<Century (in quarters): 1/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<The Countess of Bedford to Jane Lady Cornwallis<(1617),<The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis,<number 33, pp. 46-48.$N DEAR MADAM, — I have nothing to accuse you$N of, though you cannot but condemn me as a$N promise breaker, and so unmannerly a one as not<p. 47$N so much as to have excused myself to you; but I$N must truly protest that every week since my$N coming out of Warwickshire I have been setting a$N day to come to you.

I remember well what it was you$N feared at your last being in town, and I am sorrier$N than I can tell you, that there is such a resemblance$N in our destinies as makes you, like me, a$N true professor to yourself of ills to come, wherein$N I have seldom failed. But, for all that, you$N must not lose courage, nor let your kind sensibilities,$N which is the self-worthiest thing, make<p. 60$N you so unkind to yourself and yours as to yield$N up the strength of your resisting reason, and consent$N to sink under that melancholy such heretofore$N unexpected distaste must needs breed in$N you, which I grieve heartily to hear has already$N wrought so ill effects upon your health, and so$N strong apprehensions in your mind, though I trust$N our good God will with a safe deliverance of a$N happy birth restore you the one, and, if you be$N not wanting to yourself, so assist you as you$N shall to your contentment overcome what causes$N the other; and which, when you have recovered$N strength of body again, if you find to continue,$N in my opinion you should do well to remove$N hither, where you will have better means to$N prevail, and shall have my service, if you find$N may be fit for you to employ me, or shall find$N it that of others of more power than my own, by$N declaring that I have engaged them to take care of$N you, may become of use to you in this occasion,$N who I dare undertake shall do it very willingly$N and readily, and perhaps it would not be to ill$N purpose if there be cause. I am sure you believe$N there are not many for whom I durst engage my$N word to you so freely, and therefore will easily$N judge that I offer you the service but of two; but if$N those two give you not a good account of what I$N promise in their names, set it on my score as a$N falsehood. I should be glad you would resolve<p. 61$N to bring up your children and family, because I$N think it would be best for them and you; but if$N on the sudden you cannot accommodate yourself with$N a convenient house for them all, if it please you$N to let me have your company here while you$N are providing yourself with a convenient dwelling$N for your whole company, you shall do me a$N very great pleasure, and, though my Lord should$N be in town, no whit straiten me, for I can well$N spare your wanted lodgings. Therefore, if you love$N me, be not scrupulous to make use of them. It$N is now high time that I acknowledge the receipt of$N both your letters by this bearer, and withal how$N I apprehend your kindness so many ways expressed$N to me in them; but no words can do it, and$N so I beseech you to believe, because it is true;$N and, besides that, I am far from undervaluing,$N for misinterpret I cannot, the liberality you therein$N have used towards me, which is much more than$N ever I was a debtor for to any that ought it not$N unto me, or than I have a heart or will to accept, if$N I durst at this time say I would refuse what you$N so press, which your kindness only and the knowledge$N of your disposition takes off the shame I$N have so long detained, yet I will now keep it in$N my hands as you will have me; though I must$N still as your treasurer, not as a legacy, and that you$N will live to give me time when I shall leave the$N world, [and] be witness I am not behind hand with<p. 62$N you in affection, and desire to live in your memory$N                            be confident that there$N is none of yours to whom I will be more wanting$N in any_thing I may do for them than I would have$N been to my own if God had continued me a$N mother; and were as your request is in general,$N and extends to nothing but what I hope you believe$N not so ill of me as to think I would not$N without it have done, and more, I beseech you, if$N you can think it to any purpose, impose something$N more particularly on me, for I will perform it$N as I desire God should have mercy on me, joyfully$N I confess in your life, but as faithfully if I$N outlive you; which whether I do or not, they$N shall be no losers by what you have done for$N me, that have at the present but prayers to the$N Almighty to repay you with, which shall be$N offered up with the best devotion of$N Your faithfully loving and thankful friend,$N LADY BEDFORD.$N Harington House, this 20th of January [1618-19].$N I will, God willing, the next week send to$N inquire of your state, of which I hope to hear$N as I desire.$N To my worthy and dear friend the Lady Cornwallis.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 305<Author(s)/writer(s): Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford (1581-1627)<Place of author: Bedford House, London<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: -40 (38)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Jane Lady Cornwallis<PLace of recipient: Broome, Norfolk<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: you; dear Cornwallis<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1619<Century (in quarters): 1/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<The Countess of Bedford to Jane Lady Cornwallis.<(1619),<The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis,<number 43, p. 63.$N DEAR CORNWALLIS,$N I SEND this bearer to inquire of my sick friends,$N into which number I am extreme/*ly sorry to hear$N Mister Bacon is fallen, both for his own sake$N and yours, and as desirous as any can be to hear of$N his amendment, which I heartily pray for, and$N hope to receive the good news of at this messenger's$N return.

For what have [I] since observed in my$N employment but a few maxims of state too high for my capacity,$N and too subtle for my nature, which was cast in a plainer mould? $N Is than at least my fortune emended! Alas, my dear Lord, let me$N not think of that. For when I consider how all those of my rank$N have been dignified and benefited at home, while I have been<p. 162$N gathering of cockles upon this lake, I am in good faith impatient,$N more of the shame, than of the sense of want. Yet this is my$N comfort, that my gracious Master (as it has pleased him to let me$N know) does love me. And for the rest, philosophy shall be my$N reward, which, though it cannot keep me from need, yet it will$N teach me not to envy those that abound.$N    It was not my meaning when I took this leaf to make myself the$N subject of my letter unto your Lordship, though the remembrance of$N your ancient favours has, I know not how, made my pen so$N familiar.$N    For the public affairs, we stand here yet very ambiguously. The$N land was long since quiet, but the sea, as the more movable$N element, is still in agitation; and we are artificially kept at excessive$N charge by a mad Viceroy and a winking Pope, while the King of$N Spain, in the meanwhile, stands at the benefit of time and fortune,$N ready to authorise or disavow the event according to the success,$N which I take to be the sum of our case. But these things will be$N more particularly delivered to your lordship by this 'redeemed$N Neptune', as I have baptised him: for they here think him more$N than a man that knows so much more than themselves. And in$N truth, if any place had been vacant worthy of his sufficiency, there$N wanted no desire to hold him, as they have expressed by offers to$N himself, and declared in their letters by him to their ambassador,$N and most of all in the confident communication of their affairs and$N desires with him, which likewise include some hope of their having$N him again, as your Lordship will perceive by the subject of my$N dispatch to the King, which he carries.$N    I must add hereunto for mine own part that I have been glad$N of this occasion which has given me a better taste of him, and of$N his fair and clear dispositions, than I could take at a transitory view$N when I passed my last duty with your Lordship in Canterbury; and$N I am likewise almost not sorry that I have yet not seen a letter$N which he tells me your Lordship wrote by him unto me. For it$N would have made me the more ashamed to have done him so little$N service here, that had brought me such a favour, though I am otherwise$N not poor of your Lordship's gracious lines, whereof I preserve$N to this hour a great roll, and especially one, which I long for some$N hour to show your Lordship, because I know in your nobleness you$N cannot deny it, though in my meanness I could never deserve it.$N And here I will end your lordship's trouble with my prayers to$N our loving God for your happiness. Ever remaining,$N           Your Lordship's with an honest heart to serve you,$N                                      HENRY WOTTON.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 308<Author(s)/writer(s): Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639)<Place of author: Venice<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (50)<Status of author: nobility, writer, ambassador in Venice<Recipient: Sir Robert Naunton<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal, Right honourable; Your Honour<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: upwards<Exact date: 1619<Century (in quarters): 1/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Henry Wotton to Sir Robert Naunton (1619),<The Life and Letters of Sir Henry Wotton, ed.

Yet God, that sees no affliction to work$N sufficiently upon me, has this last night added$N another heavy one to my former woe, having$N taken my Lord Chamberlain's son. Yet with<p. 66$N this mercy to him, that he has given him the$N hope of another, my Lady being, as we think,$N with child again. But alas! this is but a fearful$N comfort to him and his friends, considering$N her estate, which gives him too much cause of$N doubt whether she will ever bring any well into$N the world or no, for certainly this took much$N harm by her unruliness both in the breeding and$N birth. Yet God is all sufficient, and I trust will$N bless so good a father with the joy of leaving$N some of his own to succeed him; and the rather$N am I encouraged to be confident He will show$N favour to him and to the prayers of his friends$N therein, because though he was very fond of this,$N yet, in those times of fear the child's being$N subject to some infirmities gave us, he ever kept a$N mind ready prepared to resign at God's pleasure$N so unexpected a blessing. Now it is come to the$N trial I am confident he will show well tempered$N effects of that religious resolution, and bear with$N patience what the Almighty has done, though$N it be/*is more to him than the loss of an only son$N to another father. My loss of a dear mother$N came not so unexpectedly as my Lord Chamberlain's$N did at this time, for to outward appearance$N his child mended, but my mother so manifestly$N decayed daily as I could not flatter myself with$N hope she could continue long; though I looked$N not her end would have been so sudden, yet the<p. 67$N disease she was subject to threatened no less,$N which I, sorting with that opinion she ever had$N since I knew her, that her end would be sudden,$N made it, I thank God, not so to her, who has$N left many ceremonies how well she was prepared$N for it, which is my unspeakable comfort. It$N now rests for me to follow as well as I can her$N good example, which God grant I may, in living$N for his service, that I may die in his favour,$N whom I beseech to bless you and yours, and you$N to recommend me affectionately to Mister Bacon, who$N made me hope at his last seeing in June I should$N have seen you here before this time, where you$N have not so true a friend as you shall ever findyour sad servant,                        LADY BEDFORD.$N Harington House, in haste, this 1st of June [1620].$N To my honourable dear friend the Lady Cornwallis.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 310<Author(s)/writer(s): Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford (1581-1627)<Place of author: Leicester<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: -40 (39)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Jane Lady Cornwallis<PLace of recipient: Broome, Norfolk<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: you; dear Cornwallis<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1620<Century (in quarters): 1/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<The Countess of Bedford to Jane Lady Cornwallis.<(1620),<The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis,<number 48, pp. 71-72.$N DEAR CORNWALLIS,$N I KNOW that by this time I have deserved and$N undergone much of your censure, if I have not$N lost all your favour; which to redeem I do protest$N unto you that the only cause you have been so$N long without hearing from me was, that I was$N ashamed to send till I could return you that part$N of your wealth you have so long been pleased to$N trust me with; to whom alone I had been beholding$N for a courtesy of this nature.

Now I send with a great deal of earnest$N longing for the return of this bearer, because by$N your brother I hear you have been ill since your$N being delivered; but I trust it is no other than$N some indisposition incident to child_bed, and that I$N shall hear you have recovered better health, which I$N wish as heartily at the least as the continuance of$N my own. Howsoever, since the very season of$N the year invites you to it, let me persuade you$N as soon as you are able to come to London,$N where the best means are for the recovery or$N confirmation of your health. You know your old$N lodgings, which, or as convenient a one if I keep$N you out of that, shall be ready for you, and I$N infinitely glad of your company and Mister Bacon's.$N I never so much longed to speak with<p. 88$N you, and to have you out of that solitary place,$N where I hear melancholy gets two much ground$N of you, which is so dangerous an enemy as I$N extremely desire to have you so near me as$N I might offer you my best assistance and service to$N overcome it in yourself, and remove the causes if$N it be possible. Therefore again I pray you to$N resolve to change place for a while; some divertissements$N at the least you will find here, from$N whence I shall not, I think, remove till after$N Midsummer term. Some account of what passes$N here, to entertain you, I will make unto you.$N First, my Lady of Richmond's loss, though it$N were such a blow from Heaven as I must confess$N I never knew given, will not kill her, of so$N strange resisting stew are our hearts made.$N She was the happiest woman I think that lived,$N for by her own confession she acknowledged, that$N if she should have sit down and studied what$N to ask of God for outward blessings and inward$N comforts of this world more than she enjoyed, she$N could find nothing to desire but a child; and it$N was true, for she had of glory and greatness as$N much as a subject was capable of, wealth of all$N kinds in abundance, health and extraordinary$N beauty even at this age, and, above all, a noble<p. 89$N husband, that was the love of her heart, and doted$N on her with the same passion to the last hour of his$N life that he did the first month of his being in$N love with her. Out of those loving arms she$N rose not two hours before he died, and left him, as$N she thought, well, only troubled with a little pain$N in his head, which made him desirous to sleep a$N little longer; which and his death was so quiet, as$N his man sitting close to his bedside knew not when$N he departed, but fearing, because it was the day$N appointed for the parliament, that he might wake$N too late, called in a gentleman of his chamber$N that used to wake him, who drawing the curtain$N found him stark dead. I lay by chance that$N night at the Cockepitte, whither instantly this$N news was brought me, and I presently went to the$N Duchess, in whose lodgings was to be seen all that$N an unexpected calamity could show of sorrow. I$N much feared the first violence might have distracted$N her, but her passion had so liberal went$N as I think it wrought the less inwardly. Her$N hair, in discharge of a vow she had formerly$N made, she cut off close by the roots that afternoon,$N and told us of some other vows of retiredness$N she had made if she should be so miserable as$N to outlive him, which I hope she will as punctually$N perform. For my part, I confess I encourage$N her to it, which, some say, hereafter she will$N love me nothing the better for; but it is the$N counsel I should take to myself in her case, and<p. 90$N therefore I cannot spare to give it. She offers to$N deal very nobly with my Lord of Lenox, yet I$N imagine there will grow differences betwixt them$N out of his Lady's over_greediness, for they already$N refuse to accept conditions they had subscribed$N to, though, if she have not very harsh and unusual$N measure offered her, it is in her choice whether$N to part with any thing to them or no. My Lord$N of Buckingham has made his declaration to the$N parliament, who yet applaud it because it tends$N to the final breach of the match with Spain.$N The Houses have sit so short a time as what$N they do is not yet to be judged, but I trust things$N will succeed well both for the Church and the$N Commonwealth. The Lord Marquis Hamilton is$N Lord Steward, so as that staff has had the good$N fortune to pass from a noble to a worthy hand,$N where I hope it will long remain. But I fear$N I do ill to weary you with so many lines; therefore,$N dear Cornwallis, I will not for the present say$N more than that I love you as your own merit$N and the obligations I owe you justly deserves,$N and will never be wanting to you in any trial$N you may have cause to make of$N Your most affectionate and faithful friend,$N LADY BEDFORD.<p. 91$N We have much hope that the Prince will show$N himself of such a temper as will be his own$N glory and the good of these kingdoms,$N My Lord Steward has taken from me your old$N servant James Henly, and George Purser, whom$N he should not have had, if they had not been such$N as but for his sake I should very unwillingly have$N parted with. Recommend me, sweet Cornwallis,$N very kindly to Mister Bacon; and to my friendFrederick, whom and the rest of yours I beseech$N God to bless.$N Harington House, this 28th of February [1623-4].--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 318<Author(s)/writer(s): Nathaniel Bacon, father of Anne Bacon<Place of author: Bury<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+<Status of author: painter<Recipient: Jane Lady Cornwallis<PLace of recipient: Broome, Norfolk<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: you; sweet heart<Relation of correspondents: equal<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1624<Century (in quarters): 1/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<Nathaniel Bacon to Jane Lady Cornwallis,<(1624),<The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis,<number 59, pp. 91-92.$N SWEET HEART,$N I DO long much to hear how you do, with little$N Jane; wherefore I have sent this messenger, by$N whom I desire to receive an answer.

The Lord therefore give us all grace$N not to delay preparing to be ready whensoever$N He shall please to call us, and then the sooner$N He takes us out of this miserable world the more$N cause we shall have to magnify his compassion.$N Dear Madam, return my thanks and affectionate$N salutations to your husband, and believe that,$N though it will be with a sadder heart, I shall ever$N continue to love you as your kindness has from$N time to time given me cause, which is all so unfortunate$N a woman as I am can deserve it by; but$N of that you shall never want any real proof can$N be given by$N Your most affectionate and thankful friend,$N LADY BEDFORD.$N I know I need not tell you that I take your$N kind sending as kindly as is possible, and$N that I thank you more for it than I can set down.$N More Lodge, this 23rd of March 1624-5.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 322<Author(s)/writer(s): Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford (1581-1627)<Place of author: Harington House, London<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: 40+ (43)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Jane Lady Cornwallis<PLace of recipient: Broome, Norfolk<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: you; dear Cornwallis<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1624<Century (in quarters): 1/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<The Countess of Bedford to Jane Lady Cornwallis.<The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis,<(1624)<number 81, pp. 121-123.$N DEAR CORNWALLIS,$N THE good news of Mister Bacon's amendment was$N exceeding/* exceedingly welcome to me, that have a lively sense$N of all that concerns you, in whose discomforts I$N shall ever have a share, and so have now of gladness$N for the good signs of his recovery, which let$N not your affection make you so distrustful of,$N when himself, others, and you, too, find a bettering$N of his health and strength; for, when nature$N wins upon the disease, it is an argument that$N the worst is past, though lingering sicknesses$N are not shaked off at an instant, but commonly$N wear away by degrees as they came.

What the King's$N resolution is yet for his own and his father's$N servants, he has not declared farther than the$N white staves, which are to remain as they were;$N but for the green cloth, and other inferior officers$N both of the household and chamber, it is thought$N he will employ his own and dismiss his father's,$N because he has caused the latter to be all removed$N to Denmark House to attend the body,$N and lodged the former about himself at Whitehall:$N and, for aught any_body yet can discover,$N he makes his own determinations, and is very stiff$N in them; having already changed the whole face of$N the court very near to the same form it had in$N Queen Elizabeth's time, suffering none but$N the counsel and his bedchamber to come further than$N the privy chamber, where he continually abides;$N nor the counsel to go further than the privy gallery,$N and causes it to be strictly kept likewise.$N Into the presence no more are admitted than his$N own servants and gentlemen of quality. Of his$N bedchamber he has sworn none more than he had<p. 126$N before but the Duke of Buckingham, whom he$N uses very well; but, it is hoped, will be governed$N by no man, nor will he admit any of the rest as is$N thought. After the funeral it is expected that he$N will make some alterations among the great officers,$N and, the common voice is, change my Lord Chamberlain's$N staff into that I shall never but with sorrow$N see in other hand than that that held it last, and$N bestow his upon his brother. Yet so far he has$N not yet declared himself; but, if this be, I have$N taken order that, if any power remain in the$N Chamberlain for the gentlemen ushers' places,$N whethersoever of them hold that staff, it shall be$N alike for your request; and this I did because I$N think the chamber will not be settled till the principal$N officer be/*is so. The King is pleased to use$N my Lord Chamberlain that is as graciously as any$N man; which gives many much confidence, seeing$N the King so well inclined to favour honest men$N which he is known to be, and one that will never$N abuse his trust. Besides, (which, indeed, is the$N chief) he manifests much care of God's service,$N and never fails, morning and evening, coming to$N prayers to the little closet, nor being an attentive$N hearer at sermons; so as there is all good signs$N that God has set him over this kingdom for a$N blessing. This, I know, you will be glad to hear$N from one you believe would write no untruth to$N you, and that has made me (though I am not<p. 127$N much disposed to write news) set down this$N much. To which I will add, that our destined$N Queen is with all possible speed expected here,$N for whose coming the coronation will be stayed,$N that that, and her marriage and entry, may be all$N but one charge: but the first marriage in France$N will be instantly, the King having sent his proxy$N to the King of France, that either his brother or$N the Duke of Chevreux (which is Prince Joinville$N that was here) may dispatch that, so as the next$N month she is expected; all else being fully concluded,$N and they in France hastening the espousals.$N I am very glad to hear Mister Bacon has recovered$N so good health, whose welcome shall ever$N be such where I am as I owe to his merit and$N you; whose labour I do not pity so much but$N that I wish you would bear him company to this$N solitary place, where I do not desire to see many$N now living, but yourself very much. I write to$N my Lord Chamberlain to let John Fenne know$N his answer, because he came not back hither; and,$N had I been sure when I should have seen him,$N I would rather have spoken than write, though$N I know in effect it will be all one, for he knows$N by my lines as well as he could have done by$N speech that I as earnestly affect the success of$N my recommendation as I can do any_thing in his$N power to do; and I was so loth Mister Glover should$N have any_thing to impute to my least delay, as I<p. 128$N write so late the last night to my Lord Chamberlain,$N and dispatched John Fenne, as I could not$N send this from hence with him, who went earlier$N than I was awake this morning, but make haste$N it may overtake him at London. The lying$N Papists cannot be content to want my Lord$N Stuart in the beadrole of those they would have$N thought for their glory; but whosoever knew him$N living, I hope, will receive no such false opinion$N now he is dead, who, even after he was speechless,$N gave evident demonstration (being asked by$N his chaplain) that he believed to be saved by the$N merits of Christ: yet, by the folly or villainy of$N a physician waited on him (who was Popish), have$N they got some colour to invent this slander, which$N I trust will be cleared to all the world, as it is$N clear in itself to those friends from whom he had$N not a reserved thought, and that knew how far$N both in sound judgment as well as practise he$N was from approving any point of their doctrine$N disagreeing with the creed we profess. I pray$N God they knew him not so well to be the boldest$N opposer of their ends as they used means for the$N shortening of his noble days, which that they<p. 129$N were unnaturally cut off there are strong suspicions$N in the most; because being at first, by the$N testimony of all the surgeons physicians and his$N own servants, as fair a course as ever their eyes$N beheld, in the space of three hours his whole$N body, head, and every part swelled so strangely$N and gangrened so generally as it astonished them$N all; though the physicians affirm to have seen$N the like in pestilential fevers, when the spots$N break not out before death, and impute part of the$N cause to the expedient of chafing his body, at$N least for the space of an hour before he departed,$N with hot cloths, and keeping it too close in the$N bed after. God only knows the truth, who, if he$N had any wrong, I trust will in his justice declare$N it. It is true that, when he was opened in his$N stomach and head, there appeared nothing to confirm$N this jealousy, which makes the physicians confident$N it could be no poison they are in these parts$N acquainted with; yet both myself and many$N other of his friends rest not clear of doubt, though,$N but upon some farther evidence, it is not to be$N stirred in; but if ever the least light can be gotten,$N the fear of all mortal men should not hinder our$N just prosecution of so abominable a fact: which$N yet, if it were so, hastened our loss but a little;$N for all his vital parts were so decayed, as, by the$N judgment of the doctors, he could hardly have lived$N out a year, which nobody that looked on him could<p. 130$N have suspected; yet he himself told me this last$N winter that he found such an inward decay in himself$N as he knew he should live but awhile; but,$N God knows, I conceived it to be but a melancholy$N apprehension, seeing his health better to my thinking$N than it had been a year or two before, for his$N spleen seemed to trouble him less. But now I$N have many reasons to assure myself he expected$N not to live out this year, though he was sparing$N to utter that to those he knew loved him best for$N grieving them; yet now I call to mind many$N speeches of his I heeded not when they were$N spoken, might have made me take more hold what$N his opinion was of his short continuance on earth,$N where he has not left such another; nor any$N creature so great a loser as I in the death of a$N friend, whom, if it had pleased God to have longer$N spared us, would at this time both to the public$N and his private friends have been that we must$N not look to see any other. But God saw us not$N worthy of such a blessing, whose will, as it is ever$N best, whatsoever it appear to our sense, so must$N we submit ourselves to it in all things, though$N it is the hardliest practised lesson of all we learn$N in religion. My thoughts are, and ever will be,$N full of his memory, which makes me tedious when$N any_thing draws me into discourse of him; yet$N will I not excuse this temper, because it is a duty$N I owe him in this detracting time, when those<p. 131$N that durst not have breathed amiss on his least$N action while he lived will now venture as much$N as in them lies to slubber his fame, when they$N shall think themselves out of the hearing of$N those would make them keep in their venom, or$N make them smart for uttering it at the least.$N And now I have done this, it is time I end,$N whose love and respect to you shall be endless, in$N which, to my sorrow, you cannot have so much$N advantage as I have satisfaction to know myself$N for your most affectionate and faithful, though$N most unfortunate friend, LADY BEDFORD.$N P. S. Dear Madam, recommend me affectionately$N to Mister Bacon, whom if you will bring hither this$N spring, I hope you would both find good by$N our air, which hitherto has held free from infection; $N and should be glad to see any of yours, too, with$N you$N More Lodge, this 12th of April [1625].--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 324<Author(s)/writer(s): Dorothe Randolph (Cornwallis)<Place of author: x<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: x<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Jane Lady Cornwallis<PLace of recipient: Broome, Norfolk<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: you; My most honoured Lady<Relation of correspondents: friend<Ranks of correspondents: upward<Exact date: 1625<Century (in quarters): 2/17<Educational background: x<Dialect: x<Dorothe Randolph to Jane Lady Cornwallis.<The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis,<(1625)<number 84, pp. 131-132.$N MY MOST HONOURED LADY,$N I CAN let no messenger pass without the remembrance$N of my love and service to you.

McClure,<Letter 474, pp. 618-619.$N    My very good Lord: the wind hangs so at Northwest that I doubt$N neither our letters nor yours can find passage: else should we not be thus$N long in suspense, by reason of a rumour that has held there eight or$N nine days that our side has received a great blow, wherein Sir Thomas$N Winne, Sir Walter Devreux, Captain Tubbe, Captain Dakers, and I$N know not how many more should be lost. Though this be yet but a$N verbal report without any certainty by writing, yet it is generally believed,$N for all news commonly proves too true. Our parliament that was$N to begin on Tuesday is prorogued till the last of this month, and it is$N doubted whether or where it will hold than, for if the sickness increase$N as it begins, it is thought both that and the next term shall be removed$N to Oxford or Winchester. Our whole number this week was 379: of$N the plague 71: parishes infected 17. We have many proclamations$N daily, one among the rest that no person coming from places infected$N presume to come near the court, another for the repressing of the insolence$N of our soldiers now in their way to Plymouth that begin to$N follow the steps of their predecessors that went with Mansfield, in pillaging$N and spoiling whatsoever they can lay hand on. Our navy is not<p. 619$N yet so forward that there needs such haste. The common opinion is now$N that they go to the West Indies, which me thinks were too long and$N hazardous a voyage for such a fleet. The King’s funeral sermon is come$N forth, wherein the Lord Keeper has showed a great deal of wit and$N learning in comparing King James to King Salomon in all his actions$N saving his vices. The Earl of Middlesex is retired to his house at Copthall$N in Wessex, having compounded for his fine with 5000 pounds ready money, his$N farm of the sugars, and the house at Chelsea, which they say the King$N has bestowed on the Duke of Buckingham as likewise that he has given$N the Lord Conway a pension of 2000 pounds a year for 21 years out of the$N court of wards. Our order of the Garter is much graced by the election$N of the Earls of Dorset, Holland, and the Lord Andover. The Earl$N of Northampton is said to be gone after the Duke to Paris but I should$N rather take it to be the Lord Compton. Mary I cannot conceive the$N reason why Sir Paul Banning should post thither this day sevenight unless$N there be a purpose to lay him to pawn. Sackvile Crow arrived here on$N Thursday from the Duke and brings word how noble he and his train$N were entertained, that all things go well, that the delay of the Queen’s$N coming was only hers and the King her brothers sickness, and that she is$N already on the way hitherward. One of his principal errands is to carry$N the Duke’s gay clothes. I hear that secretary Morton is to be with you$N shortly as extraordinary ambassador and comes directly from Paris,$N having his entertainment of four pound a day allowed from three or$N four days before he went. The Duchess of Buckingham is said to be$N with child which is no small joy. So with the remembrance of my best$N service to my good lady I commend you to the protection of the Almighty.$N      From London this 21st  of May 1625.$N                      Your Lordships most assuredly at command$N                                                   JOHN CHAMBERLAIN.$N The King goes toward Canterbury to meet the Queen on Friday the$N 27 of this month.$N To the right honourable Sir Dudley Carleton Lord ambassador for his$N Majesty at the Hague.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 326<Author(s)/writer(s): John Chamberlain<Place of author: London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: x<Status of author: courtier<Recipient: Sir Dudley Carleton<PLace of recipient: The Hague<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Lord<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1625<Century (in quarters): 1/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton (1625),<The Letters of John Chamberlain, ed.

I cannot so much lament$N the rest whose lives were well bestowed to redeem us out of so dull a$N lethargy, and to make the world see our wonted courage is not quite lost:$N for I could never commend those wary gamesters that rather than venture$N to set up a small rest sometimes would loose all their money in stakes.$N We talk of a rich Holland East Indian ship that lay last week two$N whole days in the Downes, in sight of the King’s ships that would not see$N her, whereby we may easily perceive how the world goes. Our soldiers$N pass daily towards Plymouth where Sir John Ogle and others are to$N train and discipline them. The common speech runs of 15000 land$N soldiers at least; a band of Bedfordshire men (they say) have killed their$N lieutenant or conductor and are run away and dispersed. We have now$N almost every day posts out of France that bring word the Queen is on$N her way by this time as far as Amiens, where she is to tarry three days$N and makes account to be at Bologna by Whitsunday eve, and here the$N Saturday after. The French king promises to overtake her at Amiens$N and there take his leave, but the Queen regnant and Queen mother accompany$N her to the seaside, so that we are like to have three Queens at$N Bullen to answer the three kings of Cullen. The King goes hence on$N Tuesday through to Canterbury and so to Dover. The pensioners$N and some of the train are gone before, but the foremost were the Marquise$N Hamilton, the countesses of Buckingham, Denbigh and Anglesey$N with the French Lady Carie who went away on Thursday with intent$N to go to Bologna, where the Lady Carie says she must cast herself at$N the Queen dowagers feet for ancient favours. Here is a new world of$N Scottish men come, thirty Lords at least in the court at once, but it is$N hoped the King’s journey will disperse them; there is no remedy (they say)$N but the King must go into Scotland to be crowned: which yet he may<p. 621$N do at leisure I hope. Our weekly bill is not much risen this week,$N there being 401 in all, of the plague 78, parishes infected sixteen; the$N Lord of Bristow is said to be very sick and in danger. Quester was$N overthrown this day sevenight in a suit about the postmaster’s office,$N wherein the Lord Stanhop prevailed against him. This day a great$N cause and that has long depended was determined in the exchequer$N chamber between the Lord Sheffield and one Ratcliffe, wherein Ratcliffe$N went to the wall to his utter undoing. I was minded to send a list of$N the Ladies that are appointed to meet the Queen at Dover, but it varies$N and alters so often that it were to no purpose: their number is about$N four or five and twenty all their coaches furnished with six horses,$N which comes altogether now in fashion, a vanity of excessive charge and$N of little use. Your brother Carleton was in town this week but after$N his wont came to fetch fire (as they say) and tarried not above two days.$N The Lord of Arundel has played a friendly part with the Lady Fanshaw$N and caused the King to send for all her pictures great and small:$N which may serve for a caveat that if you bring home any you esteem, he$N may be the last should see them, least he reap the thanks FR_à_votre_dispense.$N Young Master Fanshaw recommends this letter to his brother if he$N may be found, for it seems he obscures himself and would not that any$N of his friends should know what becomes of him, nor what course he means$N to take, or under what captain, colonel or general he has put himself$N that they may know how to hear of him: If you can learn by any that$N come from the army or by any other means, what he does it will be held$N for a great favour from your Lordship. So with the remembrance of$N my best service to my good Lady I commend you to the protection of$N the Almighty.

Yesterday your company only was at Hereford, to show$N what they had learned, where Sir John Skidemore and Mr. Vahan$N were judges; and so they mean to be of the rest of the companies,$N and they have appointed ten of your company to learn the use of$N their arms and so to teach the rest.

My fear of relapsing$N makes me content to punish myself this$N spring by following a course of physic/*medicine Sir Theodor$N Mayerne has put me into, though I am$N very incredulous that it can prevent my having$N more fits of the gout; howsoever, when I am$N troubled with any, they are accompanied with such$N accidents of sickness as shows they proceed from$N such humours as physic uses to correct, against$N which I have too rebellious a spleen I doubt to$N be brought into such obedience as not faster to<p. 146$N power out the sourness thereof into my stomach,$N and distil it into other parts, than all the apothecary’s$N drugs will be able to correct. What I do,$N therefore, is rather because it shall not be laid to$N my charge that I neglect the means of health,$N than out of any great hope of cure by it, which$N whether I have or no, God, I trust, will give me$N thankfulness to Him and patience till His appointed$N time of releasing me from all misery; of which$N we are yet like to have in general more and$N more, if this Parliament and the King part not$N upon better terms than yet they stand, the King$N having declared himself stiff one way, and they$N growing stronger and stronger in their resolutions$N another. They have had some way given them,$N which is understood by them as a good sign of$N the King's relenting, who may, if he please, have$N of them what none of his predecessors ever had of$N their people, so they may with all have their bargain,$N without which they think all their liberality$N would be no better than cast away: what the$N event will be, a few days more will show. In$N the mean_time my Lord Marshall remains at the<p. 147$N Tower, though my Lord Chamberlain is labouring to$N get his prison changed to his own house at$N Highgate. I wish another time had been taken$N for that hasty business, in regard of the want of so$N able a man at this time in the upper house, whether$N there is no probability he will be suffered to$N come this session though he were enlarged.

I asked her what her$N portion was: she told me she had one thousand$N pounds in money and a hundred pounds a year$N land of inheritance, and they valued this at five$N thousand pounds or thereabouts. I made answer,$N I had not heard any_thing of it from you, but I$N thought you would not accept of so small a portion$N with any_body; besides, you would rather have$N money than land: but this I said from myself.$N You may give what answer you please, and, if you$N like not of it, you need return no answer to Mister$N Chitting, for I have put off my Lady Barrington$N from any hope of it; therefore, if (it) please/*pleases you, let Mister$N Chitting say nothing that he has acquainted you<p. 209$N with it, because I think you will deny it, and I$N would have nothing hinder the proceeding of a business$N which I have some hope may come to good,$N which is this: As I was with my Lady Barrington,$N there came in Sir William Curtene, a Dutchman,$N and two of his daughters, the one of which was$N so conveniently handsome that I wished her my$N cousin's wife if she had ten thousand pounds; to$N which Lady Barrington answered, they were reported$N to have so much a piece, and their father$N might give them more if he liked the conditions,$N for he is very rich. I asked the lady if she had$N so much interest in them as to propound such a$N business with hope of success, and whether she$N would be pleased to favour her friends so much as$N to do it: to which she answered, she had some$N power there, and would use her best endeavours if$N she might receive full commission from me, which I$N must first receive from you, and so will proceed by$N your direction. Now, to give you some account of$N your friends and servants here, of which my mother$N is one that returns you many thanks for your$N kind wishes to her and her business, in which yet<p. 210$N we can do nothing.

You sent three open, one$N to him, one to Sir William Plaiters, and one to$N me; but I delivered them to them both with my$N own hands, and I think they both believed I looked$N not in them; for, if I did not, my cousin was very$N testy at the receiving of it, which had I known$N I would have sealed it for him. I think he means$N to come quarrel with you for it if he can find no$N greater matter, for he intends to come to you as$N soon as the term is done.

I told his Lady the manner<p. 249$N of his carriage at Broome, and that it was his own$N fault he came away upon no better terms. She$N professes she knows his heart much desires a sincere$N reconcilement; and the contrary, if it continue/*continues$N so, will shorten his life: yet I perceive not him to$N be so forward as she; but I know nothing but$N that he is so backward to come to me, where he$N might further that he so much desires. It will$N be too tedious to commit to writing all that$N passed between my Lady Cornwallis and me; only$N this in general, she much desires, as she says,$N still to do any_thing that might give you satisfaction.$N For the money, when she could get it, you$N should have it; and, if in the mean_time the King$N and Queen's promise from their own mouths to you$N will any way give you content, she will not fail to$N procure that, and she desired me to write you$N word so, which I made answer it was better for$N her to write it herself. I knew not how you would$N like it, yet I let it go on, that you might take that$N occasion to speak with the King; and I think it$N may serve you for the money well, and be a means$N to get it sooner than they can otherwise, and it$N will be a cause that any_body will think sufficient$N to bring you to town. My Lady was afraid any_thing$N that she should write would be unpleasing to$N you, but I strived to persuade her from that;$N because, if you should accept any_thing that she$N offers, you might have it under her own hand, for<p. 250$N she might forget what she said to me, and I$N might be accused for mistaking.$N I think you were never troubled with so tedious$N a letter, and therefore now I will conclude,$N with a hearty wish of all happiness to you and$N yours; and so, sweet Madam, once more farewell.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 351<Author(s)/writer(s): Dorothe Randolph<Place of author: London<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: x<Status of author: nobility?<Recipient: Jane Lady Bacon<PLace of recipient: Broome, Norfolk<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: you; my most honoured Lady<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1632<Century (in quarters): 2/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: x<Dorothe Randolph to Jane Lady Bacon,<(1632),<The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis,<number 164, p. 255.$N MY MOST HONOURED LADY,$N I find my Lady Cornwallis in the same mind$N still of desiring your favour, and a willingness to$N have you come up, but not to have the King send$N for you; but I doubt not but she will be easily$N advised to make it her suit to you to come, that$N you may receive the King and Queen's promise for$N the money; but I perceive she is a little afraid$N you should fall upon business past when you$N shall speak with the King, not as it concerns Sir$N Fredrick but him_self, in the matter of his$N injuring you.

I$N must confess the hand is so like my husband's,$N that I verily believe it came from him, but where$N he should think I should have the money I cannot$N imagine; and, too, one of those letters I sent to your$N Ladyship last was dated the same day that the merchant’s$N note was, which was the 24 of May, and in$N that he spoke of no such thing. Now what in$N the world to say to this merchant for the present$N I know not, because they say that if bills be$N not presently paid here, they send back and protest$N them there, and then nobody will trust them$N for any_thing. Now, if that would bring him home,$N it were no matter; but, alas! I fear it will not:$N therefore I told the man, more to delay the time$N a_while, than for any hopes that I had of the$N money, because I think there is more paid already$N to him and for him than is due to him of his half$N year's revenue, that I myself was altogether unprovided$N of such a sum of money, and that he$N said nothing of it in his letter to me; but I would<p. 271$N send down to them that had the ordering of his$N business, to see if there were any money to be had,$N but named nobody. I told him it would be near$N a fortnight before I could hear an answer, which$N time he was content to stay before he sent back$N to protest him. Now I beseech you, Madam, give$N me your advice what to say to him, for I know not$N where to have the money; for, as for that that I$N am to have for the half year, I have so long$N promised payment of what I can possibly spare,$N that I should be loth to fail them, if I wanted not$N food for my servants and myself, being my husband$N has a competence besides; for out of 150£ I$N am sure I have promised above 6 score pound,$N shift as I can, and they come and send daily for it,$N but as yet we can get none out of the Exchequer.$N I humbly beseech God to preserve my poor$N husband, and bring him home in safety to us; but,$N Madam, these 2 months are mighty long. But,$N good Mother, I beseech you, be you cheerly/*cheery and$N make much of your_self; and with these receive my$N humble thanks for our poor sweet babes, whom I$N most humbly beseech Almighty God to bless with$N His saving grace. Truly, Madam, I long to see$N them and you, and you and them: and I hope the$N Queen's being with child, which now begins to$N be publicly spoken of, shall be no hindrance to$N my coming to your Ladyship, though I fear it will be to my$N stay with you; for the Queen had given me leave<p. 272$N to a come/*coming to your Ladyship when she had gone her progress,$N and then I should have had too months or 6 weeks to$N have stayed with you, and now I fear I shall be cut$N short of that time.

STORIE,          St. Ives, 11th January 1635.$N    Amongst the catalogue of those good works which$N your fellowcitizens and our countrymen have done,$N this will not be reckoned for the least, that they have$N provided for the feeding of souls. Building of hospitals$N provides for men's bodies; to build material$N temples is judged a work of piety; but they that procure$N spiritual food, they that build up spiritual temples,$N they are the men truly charitable, truly pious. Such$N a work as this was your erecting the lecture in our$N country; in the which you placed Dr. Wells, a man of$N goodness and industry, and ability to do good every$N way, not short of any I know in England: and I am$N persuaded that, since his coming, the Lord has by$N him wrought much good among us.$N    It only remains how that He who first moved you$N to this, put you forward in the continuance thereof: it$N was the Lord; and therefore to Him lift we up our$N hearts that He would perfect it. And surely, Mr. Storie,$N it were a piteous thing to see a lecture fall, in the<p. 88$N hands of so many able and godly men, as I am persuaded$N the founders of this are; in these times, wherein$N we see they are suppressed, with too much haste and$N violence, by the enemies of God his Truth. Far be it$N that so much guilt should stick to your hands, who live$N in a city so renowned for the clear shining light of the$N Gospel. You know, Mr. Storie, to withdraw the pay$N is to let fall the lecture: for who goes to warfare at$N his own cost! I beseech you therefore in the bowels$N of Jesus Christ, put it forward, and let the good man$N have his pay.

I am sure they have$N been so to me this winter. I had my man Woddull$N at Newmarket this week, and it was some$N trouble to my mind that he should come so near and$N not wait of your Ladyship; but his business was not$N mine, but my Lady Holland's, for she borrowed him$N to go to Cambrey upon the report that the Prince$N Elector would not go there. Madam, I humbly$N thank you for your good news of my husband and$N his bairns/*child, and for your love and favour to us all,$N which I beseech God to reward you for us all$N with His saving grace; and I believe that if my$N husband had stayed longer with your Ladyship, which I$N should have been glad of, he would have been clean well:$N but I hear he means to be here Saturday,$N therefore I will not write to him. Madam, I have$N not seen Mister Morse, but I did much fear that he$N would be so near coming up when my husband$N came down, that there would be nothing now done$N in his business: and Mister Morse told me that your$N Ladyship might have assurance and the remainder settled$N there as well as here, which I was very glad$N of; for I know your Ladyship cannot come here but with$N much trouble and charge, and we had need be as$N sparing of that as we can in small matters, since<p. 283$N necessity forces us to crave your assistance in so$N great a proportion; for truly, Madam, if you do$N not help, I much fear all will be naught. But$N truly, Madam, my husband is very good; but, if$N he put his estate into a stranger's hand, I shall$N never look to see any part of it again: but for$N your favour to me in desiring to keep my jointure free,$N I cannot say enough, but I shall lay it up in a thankful$N heart with your many other kindnesses. But I$N hope my husband will be willing to give your Ladyship$N any assurance that you please, and truly, Madam,$N the more tie you have upon him and his estate$N the gladder I shall be, for I verily believe it will be$N [best] for him; and I pray God give us all a happy$N meeting. But when I think how troublesome I have$N been, and how unpleasing company I must yet be to$N every_body, I recall my wishes, and hope that God$N will give me that happiness when I shall be more capable$N of it than now I could, being so often ill: but,$N Madam, if I do think of any_thing that my stomach$N will serve me to eat, I will make such use of your$N kind favour, for which I humbly thank your Ladyship,$N that you shall be sure to hear of me. My sister$N Jarvess and her husband were with me this day;$N they both present their service to your Ladyship. Gordon, the$N old blade, presents his humble service and thanks$N for the cheese, and says your Ladyship’s kindness is much$N more to him than the cheese, and that one of these<p. 284$N days he will present you with an epistle. My$N Lord Carlell is hugely amended after his physic,$N and, they say now, will not die at this time. Some$N says here that the Treasurer's staff shall be cared$N by a pair of lawn sleeves. I have given my cousin$N Randolph your Ladyship’s letters. I humbly kiss your$N hands, as$N Your Ladyship’s most affectionate daughter,$N eliza cornwallis.$N Pray, Madam, be pleased to bless and buss the$N babes for me. Sir Thomas Stafford presents his$N service: he is piteously in love, and some times he's$N in hope and some times in despair, and what will$N be his end I know not. The Prince of the Temple,$N they say, has sent to offer his service to my cousin$N Semer, and they say she has refused him; but$N they say that by Easter, or before, we shall have$N two of our French women married to Englishmen,$N Crittian to Sir Thomas Shelly's son, and Catoe to$N Mister Arpe.

My Lady Nuport’s daughters’ was$N not the plague, thanks be to God! Truly, Madam,$N I did much fear your being very weary of so long$N and solitary a journey; and my husband said that he$N was sorry he was put to ask to stay, for that case$N stays him still in town, as he says to me, for I$N have not as yet seen him since that day that you$N went out of town; but he on Sunday sent Mister$N Tom Howard to me, that I would be ready to go,<p. 288$N into the beginning of the next week.

It is my joy that you are well, and I beseech the$N Lord to continue your health, and above all to give you that<p. 10$N grace in your soul which may make you have a healthful soul,$N sound without errors, active in all that is good, industrious in all$N the ways in which good is to be gained. I am glad you find a$N want of that ministry you did enjoy: labour to keep a fresh desire$N after the sincere milk of the word, and than in good time you$N shall enjoy that blessing again. The Lord has promised to give$N his spirit to his children, which shall lead them in the truth.$N Beg that blessed Spirit, and than errors will but make the truth$N more bright, as the foil does a diamond. My dear Ned, as you$N have been careful to choose your company, be so still, for pitch will$N not easily be touched without leaving some spot. I had not heard of$N Duke Roberts and my Lord Crauen’s being taken. I hope the news of$N the Swedes is not true; but in all these things we must remember$N the warning, which our Saviour has given us, when he had told$N his disciples that there must be wars and rumours of wars; (but$N he says, let not your hearts be troubled; in my apprehension, as if$N Christ had said) great troubles and wars must be, both to purge his$N church of hypocrites, and that his enemies at the last may be utterly$N destroyed, but you my servants be not careful for yourselves, you$N are my jewels, and the days of trouble are the days when I take$N care of jewels; and, my dear Ned, though I firmly believe there$N will be great troubles, yet I look with joy beyond those days of$N trouble, considering the glory that the Lord will bring his church$N to; and happy are they that shall live to see it, which I hope you$N will do. I heard that there was a cardinal’s cape brought to$N the custom house, valued at a high rate, but none would own it;$N and, to requite your intelligence, I let you know what I hear.$N The Scot business is not yet ended. There is lately come to the$N court a fresh duke with two or three other gentlemen or noble$N men, being fled from the French king's army, for some unfitting$N words they used of the French king. The Queen mother was$N so transported with joy, as they say, at the sight of the queen, that$N she was in a trance. This day I heard it confirmed from London$N that the Palsgrave in beseeching a town in Westfalia was<p. 11$N raised and most of his army defeated, and his brother taken prisoner;$N but this is our comfort, that the rod of the wicked shall not always$N rest on God’s people. I have sent Hall purposely to see you; for$N since I cannot speak with you, nor see you so often as I desire,$N I am willing to make these paper messengers my deputy. I$N hope I shall hear from you by this messenger; I thank God your$N father is well, and your brother Robert has had no fit since you$N went. He goes to school and eats his meat well; and I hope the$N Lord will spare him. You must write to him; you know he is apt$N to apprehend unkindness. When you write by the carrier, write$N nothing but what any may see, for many times the letters miscarry.$N My dear Ned, you may see how willing I am to discourse with$N you, that have spun out my letter to this length. I thank God$N my cold is gone. I beseech the Lord to bless you, as I desire my$N own soul should be blessed:$N       Your most affectionate mother,      BRILLIANA HARLEY.$N    I have sent you a cake, which I hope you will eat in memory of $N Bromton.$N Bromton, Nov. 17, 1638.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 365<Author(s)/writer(s): Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658)<Place of author: Ely<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: -40 (39)<Status of author: gentry, military and political leader<Recipient: Mrs. St. John<PLace of recipient: Essex<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: personal<Relation of correspondents: family, cousins<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1638<Century (in quarters): 2/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: educated<Oliver Cromwell to Mrs. St. John (1638),<Oliver Cromwell’s Letters and Speeches, ed.

Alas, you$N do too highly prize/*praise my lines, and my company, I may be$N ashamed to own your expressions, considering how unprofitable$N I am, and the mean improvement of my talent.$N    Yet to honour my God by declaring what He has$N done for my soul, in this I am confident, and I will$N be so.

I live,$N you know where,  in Meshec, which they say signifies$N prolonging; in Kedar, which signifies blackness:$N yet the Lord forsakes me not. Though He does prolong,$N yet He will I trust bring me to His tabernacle, to His$N resting-place. My soul is with the congregation of the$N firstborn, my body rests in hope; and if here I may<p. 99$N honour my God either by doing or by suffering, I shall$N be most glad.$N    Truly no poor creature has more cause to put himself$N forth in the cause of his God than I. I have had$N plentiful wages beforehand; and I am sure I shall never$N earn the least mite/*piece. The Lord accept me in His--$N Son, and give me to walk in the light,  and give us$N to walk in the light, as He is the light! He it is that$N enlightens our blackness, our darkness. I dare not$N say, He hides His face from me. He gives me to$N see light in His light. One beam in a dark place has--$N exceeding much refreshment in it:  blessed be His$N name for shining upon so dark a heart as mine! You know$N what my manner of life has been. Oh, I lived$N in and loved darkness, and hated light; I was a chief,$N the chief of sinners. This is true: I hated godliness,$N yet God had mercy on me. O the riches of His mercy! --$N begun a good work would perfect it in the day of Christ.$N    Salute all my friends in that family whereof you$N are yet a member. I am much bound unto them for$N their love. I bless the Lord for them; and that my$N son, by their procurement, is so well. Let him have$N your prayers, your counsel; let me have them.--$N    Salute your husband and sister from me:  he$N is not a man of his word! He promised to write about$N Mr. Wrath of Epping; but as yet I receive no letters:--put him in mind to do what with convenience may$N be done for the poor cousin I did solicit him about.$N    Once more farewell.

Carlyle, vol. I,<Letter XVIII, pp. 170-174.$N To his honoured friends, Sir William Spring and Mr. Barrow:$N                     These present.$N Gentlemen,       'Holland, Lincolnshire,' 28th September 1643.$N    It has pleased God to bring off Sir Thomas Fairfax$N his horse over the river from Hull, being about$N onetwenty troops of horse and Dragoons. The<p. 171$N Lincolnshire horse laboured to hinder this work, being$N about thirtyfour colours of horse and dragoons: we$N marched up to their landingplace, and the Lincolnshire$N horse retreated.$N    After they were come over, we all marched towards$N Holland; and when we came to our last quarter upon$N the edge of Holland, the enemy quartered within four$N miles of us, and kept the field all night with his whole$N body: his intentment/*intention, as we conceive, was to fight us;--or hoping to interpose betwixt us and our retreat;$N having received, to his thirtyfour colours of horse,$N twenty fresh troops, ten companies of 'Dragoons;'$N and about a thousand foot, being general King's own$N regiment. With these he attempted our guards and$N our quarters; and, if God had not been merciful, had$N ruined us before we had known of it; the five troops$N we set to keep the watch failing much of their duty.$N But we got to horse; and retreated in good order, with$N the safety of all our horse of the association; not$N losing four of them that I hear of, and we got five$N of theirs. And for this we are exceedingly bound to$N the goodness of God, who brought our troops off with$N so little loss.$N    I write unto you to acquaint you with this; the$N rather that God may be acknowledged; and that you$N may help forward, in sending such force away unto us$N as lie unprofitably in your country. And especially$N that troop of Captain Margery's, which surely would$N not be wanting, now we so much need it! $N    I hear there has been much exception taken to$N Captain Margery and his officers, for taking of horses.$N I am sorry you should discountenance those who (not<p. 172$N to make benefit to themselves, but to serve their$N country) are willing to venture their lives, and to$N purchase to themselves the displeasure of bad men, that$N they may do a public benefit.  I undertake not to$N justify all Captain Margery's actions: but his own conscience$N knows whether he has taken the horses of any--$N but malignants/*malicious people;  and it were somewhat too hard to$N put it upon the consciences of your fellow deputy$N lieutenants, whether they have not freed the horses of$N known malignants/*malicious people! A fault not less, considering the$N sad estate of this kingdom, than to take a horse from$N a known honest man; the offence being against the$N public, which is a considerable aggravation! I know$N not the measures everyone takes of malignants/*malicious_people. I$N think it is not fit Captain Margery should be the$N judge; but if he, in his taking of horses, has observed$N the plain character of a malignant, and cannot--$N be charged for one horse otherwise taken,  it had$N been better that some of the bitterness wherewith he$N and his have been followed had been spared! The$N horses that his coronet Boulry took, he will put himself$N upon that issue for them all.$N    If these men be accounted "troublesome to the$N country," I shall be glad you would send them all to$N me. I'll bid them welcome. And when they have$N fought for you, and endured some other difficulties of$N war which your "honest" men will hardly bear, I$N pray you than let them go for honest men! I protest$N unto you, many of those men which are of your$N country’s choosing, under Captain Johnson, are so far--$N from serving you, that,  were it not that I have$N honest troops to master them, although they be<p. 173$N well paid, yet they are so mutinous that I may justly--$N fear they would cut my throat! -- Gentlemen, it may$N be it provokes some spirits to see such plain men made$N captains of horse. It had been well that men of honour--$N but why do they not appear! Who would have hindered$N them! But seeing it was necessary the work must go--$N on, better plain men than none;  but best to have$N men patient of wants, faithful and conscientious in their$N employment. And such, I hope, these will approve$N themselves to be. Let them therefore, if I be thought$N worthy of any favour, leave your country with your$N good wishes and a blessing. I am confident they will$N be well bestowed. And I believe before it be long,$N you will be in their debt; and than it will not be hard$N to quit scores.$N    What arms you can furnish them withal, I beseech$N you do it. I have hitherto found your kindness great--$N to me:  I know not what I have done to lose it; I$N love it so well, and price it so high, that I would do$N my best to gain more. You have the assured affection$N of$N             Your most humble and faithful servant,$N                              OLIVER CROMWELL.--$N P.S.  I understand there were some exceptions$N taken at a horse that was sent to me, which was$N seized out of the hands of one Mr. Goldsmith of Wilby.$N If he be not by you judged a malignant, and that you$N do not approve of my having of the horse, I shall as$N willingly return him again as you shall desire. And$N therefore, I pray you, signify your pleasure to me herein<p. 174$N under your hands. Not that I would, for ten thousand$N horses, have the horse to my own private benefit,--$N saving to make use of him for the public:  for I$N will most gladly return the value of him to the state.--$N If the gentleman stand clear in your judgements,  I$N beg it as a special favour that, if the gentleman be$N freely willing to let me have him for my money, let$N him set his own price: I shall very justly return him$N the money. Or if he be unwilling to part with him,$N but keeps him for his own pleasure, be pleased to send$N me an answer thereof: I shall instantly return him his$N horse; and do it with a great deal more satisfaction to--$N myself than keep him.

Give me leave to tell you, I cannot be of$N your judgement; 'cannot understand, if a man notorious$N for wickedness, for oaths, for drinking, has as great$N a share in your affection as one who fears an oath,--$N who fears to sin,  that this does commend your election--$N    ay, but the man "is an Anabaptist." Are you sure$N of that! Admit he be, shall that render him incapable$N to serve the public! "He is indiscreet." It may be so,$N in some things: we have all human infirmities. I tell$N you, if you had none but such "indiscreet men" about$N you, and would be pleased to use them kindly, you$N would find as good a fence to you as any you have yet$N chosen.$N    Sir, the state, in choosing men to serve it, takes$N no notice of their opinions; if they be willing faithfully--$N to serve it,  that satisfies. I advised you formerly to$N bear with men of different minds from yourself: if you$N had done it when I advised you to it, I think you$N would not have had so many stumblingblocks in your$N way. It may be you judge otherwise; but I tell you--$N my mind.  I desire you would receive this man into$N your favour and opinion. I believe, if he follow$N my counsel, he will deserve no other but respect from<p. 183$N you. Take heed of being sharp, or too easily sharpened$N by others, against those to whom you can object little$N but that they square not with you in every opinion$N concerning matters of religion. If there be any other--$N offence to be charged upon him,   that must in a$N judicial way receive determination. I know you will$N not think it fit my Lord should discharge an officer of$N the field but in a regulate way. I question whether$N you or I have any  precedent for that.--$N    I have no further to trouble you:  but rest,$N           Your humble servant,$N                  OLIVER CROMWELL. _--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 378<Author(s)/writer(s): Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658)<Place of author: Huntingdon<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (44)<Status of author: gentry, military and political leader<Recipient: Robert Barnard<PLace of recipient: x<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: personal<Relation of correspondents: close<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1643<Century (in quarters): 2/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Oliver Cromwell to Robert Rarnard (1643),<Oliver Cromwell’s Letters and Speeches, ed.

My$N Lord Grey sent Sir Edward Hartop to me, to let me$N know he could not meet me at Stamford according to$N our agreement; fearing the exposing of Leicester to the$N forces of Mr. Hastings and some other troops drawing$N the way.$N    Believe it, it were better, in my poor opinion, Leicester$N were not, than that there should not be found an$N immediate taking of the field by our forces to accomplish$N the common ends.

Here are such few helps, that I fear$N I shall make but a lingering progress, unless I have your<p. 283$N personal discourse to further and prick forwards my slow$N endeavours. But I shall determine of nothing till I see$N you here, in which journey I could wish (were it not to$N the disadvantage of your affairs) you would prevent our$N expectations. Sir, I have now by the frequency of living$N and dead dissections of dogs, run through the whole$N body of anatomy insisting upon Spigelius, Bartholinus,$N Fernelius, Columbus, Veslingius, but especially Harvey's$N circulation, and the two incomparable authors, Descartes,$N and Regius, which indeed were the only two that$N answered my doubts and quires in that art. I have likewise$N made some little proficiency in herbary, and by going$N out 3 or 4 miles once a week have brought home with$N me 2 or 3 hundred herbs. I have likewise run through$N Heurnius which I very well allow of for a Peripathetical$N author. He is something curt LAT_de LAT_urina, which I conceive$N to be a very necessary piece in physic now the circulation$N is discovered: for since the urine is channelled all$N along with the blood, through almost all the Parenchymata$N of the body, before it come to the kidneys to be$N strained and separated, it must needs carry a tincture of$N any disaffected or diseased part through which it passes.$N For Senertus, I cannot yet procure him, but 'it is said$N he’s coming out in a new letter, and than I question not$N but I shall have him.

Dr. Morley has made a very good description of$N the Queen of Sweden: she gave an assignation to the$N French Ambassador to meet her at Breda, whither he went,$N and so did the Prince and Princess of Tarente and most$N of our French gallants, who came all sneaking home again<p. 195$N for her grief was so great for the beating of the Spanish$N army before Arras as she would not go to Breda.

We have yet here no particulars$N of this defeat, but in general it is a very great one.$N I long to hear what part my godson had in it, for I still$N think of him, being my cheefest comfort next your excellent$N Master. I am very glad your daughter is so$N well, I do not wonder at it, she is so well used, and now$N she has her father with her she is the more content, and I$N take it very well that all this makes her not forget her$N friends here. I assure you I long to have her here again.$N I am very sorry for poor Killegrew, she was a very good$N gentlewoman. You will hear by Missis Howards letter$N how great a scrape my little Nephew escaped yesterday upon$N the bridge at the Princess of Orange's house, but God be$N thanked there was no hurt only the coach broken: I$N took him into my coach and brought him home. The$N Princess of Orange went from hence upon Saturday, and$N you will have our Baron shortly with you at Aix, he will$N tell you the second part of the Queen of Sweden, for he$N comes from her to your Court, tomorrow I believe I<p. 196$N shall go a shooting, which I have not done since you went.$N I am very glad to hear that you are established in your$N place, which you deserve so well.

I lay at Sir Harry de Vicks,$N who was very careful and diligent to do me all the service<p. 207$N he could. I stayed but Sunday at Brussels, and$N returned to Antwerp upon Monday, and hearing from$N Duarte how the Queen of Sueden had desired to know when$N I came back thither, that she might meet with me in an indifferent$N place, I made the more hast away the next day$N because I had no mind to speak with her since I heard how$N unhandsomely she had spoken of the king my dear brother$N and of the king my dear nephew, and indeed of all$N our nation, so I avoided it and went away as soon as I had$N dined. Yet she has sent Donoy to me with a very civil message$N that she was sorry she could not use that civility to$N me as she both should do and desired, hoping that one day$N we might meet together with more freedom; I answered$N her as civilly as I could, and now when I went from Bergen$N I gave Sir Will: Swann charge to make her a complement$N from me. I came hither upon Tuesday from Bergen,$N where I was extremely well entertained by the Princess of$N Zolern who was with me and was my guide all the journey,$N and defrayed me. Her daughter is now so pretty$N every way that you would like her yet better than ever you$N have done if you saw her; she is much grown and is still of a$N very sweet disposition and she does become her: she has a$N great deal of wit and extremely loves our nation, it makes$N me think of your wish which I am not against you$N know.

I do, once for all, give you to$N understand that I should thereby destroy and disappoint$N one of the main ends for which God has$N planted me in the station I am in.$N    Wherefore I desire you in that matter to rest secure.$N True it is that two ministers, one Mr. Cole and$N one Mr. Pye, did present to me a letter in the name$N of divers ministers of Newcastle, the bishopric of$N Durham and Northumberland; of an honest and Christian$N purpose: the sum whereof I extracted, and returned--$N an answer thereunto;  a true copy whereof$N I send you here enclosed. By which I think it will$N easily appear, that the consideration of my kindness is$N well deserved by them; provided they observe the condition$N `there' expressed; which in charity I am bound$N to believe they will; and without which their own$N consciences and the world will know how to judge of$N them.$N    Having said this, I, or rather the Lord, require of$N you, that you walk in all peaceableness and gentleness,$N inoffensiveness, truth and love towards them, as$N becomes the servants and Churches of Christ. Knowing<p. 3$N well that Jesus Christ, of whose diocese both they$N and you are, expects it. Who, when He comes to$N gather His people, and to make Himself "a name and--$N "praise amongst all the people of the earth,"  He$N "will save her that halts, and gather her that was$N "driven out, and will get them praise and fame in$N "every land, where they have been put to shame."$N And such "lame ones" and "driven-out ones" were$N not the Independents only, and Presbyterians, a few$N years since, by the Popish and Prelatical Party in$N these nations; but such are and have been the Protestants--$N in all lands,  persecuted, and faring alike$N with you, in all the Reformed Churches. And therefore,$N knowing your charity, to be as large as all the$N flock of Christ who are of the same hope and faith$N of the Gospel with you; I thought fit to commend--$N written in your heart, so to do with this that I shall$N stand by you in the maintaining of all your just privileges$N to the uttermost.$N    And committing you to the blessing of the Lord,$N I rest$N                        Your loving friend,$N                           Oliver P. _--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 402<Author(s)/writer(s): Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658)<Place of author: Whitehall, London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: gentry, military and political leader<Recipient: Cardinal Mazarin<PLace of recipient: Paris<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: his Eminency<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1656<Century (in quarters): 3/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Oliver Cromwell to Cardinal Mazarin (1656),<Oliver Cromwell’s Letters and Speeches, ed.

But although$N I have this set home upon my spirit, I may$N not (shall I tell you, I cannot? ) at this juncture of$N time, and as the face of my affairs now stands, answer$N to your call for toleration.$N   I say, I cannot, as to a public declaration of my$N sense in that point; although I believe that under my$N government your eminency, in the behalf of Catholics,$N has less reason for complaint as to rigour  upon men's$N consciences than under the parliament. For I have of$N some, and  those very many, had compassion; making$N a difference. Truly I have (and I may speak it with$N cheerfulness in the presence of god, who is a witness$N within me to the truth of what I affirm) made a difference;$N and, as Jude speaks, "plucked many out of the--$N fire,"  the raging fire of persecution, which did<p. 6$N tyrannise over their consciences, and encroached by an$N arbitrariness of power upon their estates. And herein$N is my purpose, as soon as I can remove impediments,$N and some weights that press me down, to make a$N farther progress, and discharge  my promise to your$N eminency in relation to that.$N And now I shall come to return your Eminency$N thanks for your judicious choice of that person to whom$N you have entrusted our weightiest affair: an affair$N wherein your Eminency is concerned, though not in an$N equal degree and measure with myself. I must confess$N that I had some doubts of its success, till providence$N cleared them to me by the effects. I was, truly and$N to speak ingenuously, not without doubtings; and shall$N not be ashamed to give your eminency the grounds I$N had for much doubting. I did fear that Berkley would$N not have been able to go through and carry on that$N work; and that either the Duke would have cooled in$N his suit, or condescended to his brother. I doubted$N also that those instructions which I sent over with$N 290 were not clear enough as to expressions; some$N affairs here denying me leisure at that time to be so$N particular as in regard to some circumstances, I$N would. If I am not mistaken in the Duke's$N character, as I received it from your Eminency, that$N fire which is kindled between  them will not ask bellows$N to blow it, and keep it burning. But what I think$N farther necessary in this matter I will send to your$N Eminency by Lockhart.$N And now I shall boast to your Eminency my security<p. 7$N upon a wellbuilt confidence in the Lord: for$N I distrust not but if this breach be widened a little$N more, and this difference fomented/*promoted, with a little caution--$N in respect of the persons to be added to it,  I distrust$N not but that party, which is already forsaken of God$N as to an outward dispensation of mercies, and noisome$N to their countrymen, will grow lower in the opinion of$N all the world.$N    If I have troubled your Eminency too long in this,$N you may impute it to the resentment of joy which I$N have for the issue of this affair; and `I' will conclude$N with giving you assurance that I will never be backward$N in demonstrating, as becomes your brother and$N confederate, that I am,$N             Your servant,$N                      Oliver P. _--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 403<Author(s)/writer(s): Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658)<Place of author: Whitehall, London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (44)<Status of author: gentry, military and political leader<Recipient: Sir William Lockhart<PLace of recipient: France<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Sir<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1657<Century (in quarters): 3/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Oliver Cromwell to William Lockhart (1657),<Oliver Cromwell’s Letters and Speeches, ed.

And that which increases our sense `of$N this' is, the resolution we `for our part' had, rather$N to overdo than to be behindhand in anything of our$N treaty. And although we never were so foolish `as'$N to apprehend that the French and their interests were$N the same with ours in all things; yet as to the Spaniard,$N who has been known in all ages to be the most implacable--$N enemy that France has,  we never could$N doubt, before we made our treaty, that, going upon$N such grounds, we should have been failed `towards' as$N we are! $N    To talk of `giving us garrisons' which are inland,$N as caution for future action; to talk of `what will be--$N done next campaign,'  are but parcels of words for$N children. If they will give us garrisons, let them give--$N us Calais, Dieppe and Bologna;  which I think$N they will do as soon as be honest in their words in$N giving us any one Spanish garrison upon the coast$N into our hands! I positively think, which I say to$N you, they are afraid we should have any footing on$N that side `of the water,' though Spanish.$N    I pray you tell the cardinal from me, that I think$N if France desires to maintain its ground, much more$N to get ground upon the Spaniard, the performance of$N his treaty with us will better do it than anything appears--$N we cannot so well pretend to soldiery as those that are$N with him; yet we think that, we being able by sea to<p. 145$N strengthen and secure his siege, and `to' reinforce it$N as we please by sea, and the enemy `being' in capacity--$N to do nothing to relieve it,  the best time to$N besiege that place will be now. Especially if we consider$N that the French horse will be able so to ruin$N Flanders as that no succour can be brought to relieve$N the place; and that the French army and our own will$N have constant relief, as far as England and France--$N especially considering the Dutch are now engaged so$N much to southward as they are.$N    I desire you to let him know that Englishmen$N have had so good experience of winter expeditions,$N they are confident, if the Spaniard shall keep the field,$N as he cannot impede this work, so neither will he be$N able to attack anything towards France with a possibility$N of retreat. And what do all delays signify$N but `even this:' the giving the Spaniard opportunity$N so much the more to reinforce himself; and the keeping$N our men another summer to serve the French, without$N any colour of a reciprocal, or any advantage to--$N    And therefore if this will not be listened unto, I$N desire that things may be consideredof to give us$N satisfaction for the great expense we have been at with$N our naval forces and otherwise; which out of an$N honourable and honest aim on our part has been incurred,$N thereby to answer the engagements we had$N made. And, `in fine,' that consideration may be had<p. 146$N how our men may be put into a position to be returned--$N to us;  whom we hope we shall employ to a better$N purpose than to have them continue where they are.$N    I desire we may know what France says, and will$N do, upon this point. We shall be ready still, as the$N Lord shall assist us, to perform what can be reasonably$N expected on our part. And you may also let the cardinal$N know father, that our intentions, as they have been,$N will be to do all the good offices we can to promote$N the interest common to us.$N    Apprehending it is of moment that this business$N should come to you with speed and surety/*certainty, we have$N sent it by an express.$N                Your very loving friend,$N                             Oliver P. _--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 404<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: -40 (39)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Christopher Richardson, mayor, and the Aldermen his brethren, of Kingston upon Hull<PLace of recipient: Newcastle<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Gentlemen, my worthy friends; you<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1660<Century (in quarters): 3/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to Christopher Richardson (1660),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

At my$N late absence out of town I had taken such order that if you had$N commanded me any thing I might soon have received it and so returned$N on purpose to this place to have obeyed you. But hearing nothing of$N that nature, however I was present the first day of the parliament’s$N sitting, and took care to write to Mr. Mayor what work we had cut out.$N Since when we have had little new but only been making a progress in$N those things I then mentioned. There is yet brought in an act in$N which of all others your corporation is the least concerned: that is$N where wives shall refuse to cohabit with their husbands, that in such$N case the husband shall not be liable to pay any debts which she shall$N run into for clothing diet lodging or other expenses. I wish with all$N my heart you were no more touched in a vote that we have made for$N bringing in an act of a new assessment for six months of 70000 pounds LAT_per$N LAT_mensem to begin next January. The truth is the delay ere/*before moneys can$N be got in eats up a great part of all that is levying and that growing$N charge of the army and navy doubles upon us. And that is all that$N can be said for excuse of ourselves to the country to whom we had$N given our own hopes of no further assessment to be raised, but must now$N needs incur the censure of improvidence before or prodigality now,$N though it becomes no private member, the resolution having passed$N the house to interpose further his own judgement in a thing that can$N not be remedied: and it will be each man’s ingenuity not to grudge$N an afterpayment for that settlement and freedom from armies and $N navies which before he would have been glad to purchase with his<p. 2$N whole fortune. There remain some eight regiments to be disbanded$N but those all horse in a manner and some seventeen ships to be$N paid of that have laid so long upon charge in the harbour beside$N fourscore/*eighty ships which are reckoned to us for this winter guard but$N after that all things are to go upon his Majesty’s own purse out of the$N tonnage and poundage and his other revenues. But there being so$N great a provision made for money I doubt not but ere we rise to see the$N whole army disbanded and, according to the act, hope to see your$N town once more ungarrisoned, in which I should be glad and happy to$N be instrumental to the uttermost for I can not but remember,$N though then a child, those blessed days when the youth of your own$N town were trained for your militia, and did methought become their$N arms much better than any soldiers that I have seen there since. And$N it will not be amiss if you please (now that we are about a new act$N of regulating the Militia that it may be as a standing strength but$N not as ill as a perpetual army to the Nation) to signify to me any$N thing in that matter that were according to your ancient custom and $N desirable for you. For though I can promise little yet I intend all$N things for your service. The act for review of the poll bill proceeds$N and that for making this declaration of his Majesty a law in religious$N matters. Order likewise is given for drawing up all the votes made$N during our last sitting in the business of sales of bishops and deans$N and chapters lands into an act which I should be glad to see passed.$N The purchasers the other day offered the house 600000 pounds in ready$N money and to make the bishops etc. revenue as good or better than$N before. But the House thought it not fit or seasonable to hearken$N to it. We are so much the more concerned to see that great interest$N of the purchasers satisfied and quieted at least in that way which our$N own votes have propounded. On Monday next we are to return to the$N consideration of apportioning 100000 pounds LAT_per LAT_annum upon all the lands in$N the nation in lieu of the court of wards. The debate among the$N counties each thinking it self overrated makes the success of that$N business something casual and truly I shall not assist it much for my$N part for it is little reason that your town should contribute in that$N charge. The excise bill for longer continuance (I wish it prove not too$N long) will come in also next week and I foresee we shall be called upon$N shortly to effect our vote made the former sitting of raising his Majesty’s$N revenue to 1200000 pounds  LAT_per LAT_annum I do not love to write so much of$N this money news but I think you have observed that parliaments$N have been always made use of to that purpose, and though we may buy$N gold too dear yet we must at any rate be glad of peace freedom$N and a good conscience. Mr. Mayor tells me your duplicates of the poll<p. 3$N are coming up I shall go with them to the exchequer and make your$N excuse if any be requisite. My long silence has made me now trespass$N on the other hand in a long letter but I doubt not of your good$N construction of so much familiarity and trouble from$N                           Gentlemen$N                      Your most affectionate friend and servant$N                            Andrew Marvell.$N Westminster November 17. 1660--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 405<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: -40 (39)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Christopher Richardson, mayor, and the Aldermen his brethren, of Kingston upon Hull<PLace of recipient: Newcastle<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Gentlemen, my worthy friends; you<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1660<Century (in quarters): 3/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to Major Richardson (1660),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

I received today$N another letter of yours of the 17th directed to my self and Mr. Ramsden$N who is not yet arrived in Mr. Wilsons business. He has been with$N me and seems to build much upon my advise. I counselled him before$N I had yours in any case not to think any more of Hezle but if he could$N (as he said he had some hopes) to make for Leeds upon Mr. Stiles his$N acceptance of Hezle. I shall be very tender and sensible of your interest$N herein and shall afford him no assistance, but on the contrary, in$N anything reflecting upon your proceedings. But as far as I can$N understand him, and I shall now be the more watchful over him, he$N has wholly laid by any such thoughts and his whole design is now$N upon Leeds. Yesterday after a long debate upon the compensation$N for the Court of Wards, it was resolved that for the tenures of lands$N in capite, knights service, Court of Wards and all the emoluments$N thereof, and for taking away of purveyance the king should have$N in perpetuity one moiety/*half of the excise of beer and ale. The other$N moiety/*half was not then disposed of but 'it is likely will come in into the$N yearly revenue of 1200000 pounds which must be settled. Today we were$N upon the act of militia which is referred to a committee of the whole$N house on Saturday next. Today also at a conference with the Lords$N his Majesty’s pleasure was signified to us that in respect of the approach$N of Christmas and his Majesty’s coronation to be prepared for shortly$N after this parliament should be dissolved the 20th of the next month.$N By how much our time is shorter I shall the more daily and diligently$N give you advice of all that passes.$N                        I remain, gentlemen,$N                    Your most affectionate friend and servant$N                                 Andrew Marvell.$N Westminster November 22. 1660.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 406<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: -40 (39)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Christopher Richardson, mayor, and the Aldermen his brethren, of Kingston upon Hull<PLace of recipient: Newcastle<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: Gentlemen, my worthy friends; you<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1660<Century (in quarters): 3/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to Major Richardson (1660),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

Today upon the recommitment$N I made my second report of that very good bill for erecting and$N augmenting vicarages out of all impropriations belonging to arch_bishops,$N deans and chapters or any other ecclesiastical$N person or corporation to 80 pounds LAT_per LAT_annum where the impropriation$N amounts to 120 pounds, and where less to one moiety/*half of the profits of such$N impropriation and the bill upon reading the amendments was$N ordered to be engrossed. After that the House fell upon the making$N out of the King’s revenue to 1200000 pounds a year and have voted that$N the other moiety/*half of the excise of beer and ale shall be given to his$N Majesty for life to make up the full of the said 1200000 pounds a year.$N And that the members of the Privy Counsel acquaint his Majesty$N from the House with their unanimity herein in gratitude for his$N Majesty's gracious declarations and acts of grace to the kingdom the$N customs are estimated toward 500000 pounds LAT_per LAT_annum in this revenue$N his lands and fee farms 250000 pounds, the excise of beer and ale 300000 pounds $N the rest arises out of the post office, wine licences, stanneries,$N courts, probates of wills, postfines, forests and other rights of the$N crown. The excise of foreign commodities is to be continued apart$N until satisfaction of public debts and engagements secured upon$N the excise. Tomorrow the bill for enacting his Majesty's declaration in$N religious matters is to have its first reading. It is said that on Sunday$N next Doctor Reynolds shall be created Bishop of Norwich.

We must first give you thanks for the kind$N present you have pleased to send us which will give occasion to us to$N remember you often, but the quantity is so great that it might make$N sober men forgetful. We have been with my Lord Bellasis and$N presented him his, and your letter. He gives you very many thanks$N and as to the business of cutting of Hull from Hezle, he answered$N what indeed we expected, that he should willingly contribute his best$N towards it at any time, but it being to be done by act of parliament$N it was at present our dissolution being so sudden, absolutely impossible.$N Had you pleased to give order sooner to us it might have been effected$N and an act prepared for it might have passed but as we said there are$N so many public bills depending and our time so short that should you$N give a 1000 pounds it could never be got into the house to be once read this$N Parliament. All these bills are yet before us in our house. For taking away$N Court of Wards and settling one moiety/*half of excise LAT_in LAT_perpetuum. For$N settling the other moiety/*half for life. For the militia. For 6 months assessment.$N For attainder. For pains and penalties. For review of poll money. For$N settling post office in his Majesty. For gathering arrears of excise and$N settling the foreign excise for some time and paying public debts secured$N upon it. For tobacco not to be planted in England. For wine licences.$N For draining the fens. For tanning leather. For increasing fishery.$N For better gathering the customs. For purchasers etc. Beside those$N which yet lie before the lords since our last recess not sent back to us.$N For confirming college leases. For uniting Dunkirk and Jamaica to$N the Crown. For paying some moneys in arrears for Piedmont. For$N indemnifying officers in courts of justice. For confirm marriages. For$N enabling Durham to send members to parliament. For confirming LAT_Magna$N LAT_Charta and a proclamation against priests and Jesuits. And beside what$N we have sent for their concurrence and not returned since this sitting.<p. 9$N For levying arrears of 12 months assessment. For strict observing$N Lord’s day. Against swearing. Against transporting wool etc. For$N vicarages. And after all these public as many private bills more and$N but ten sitting days left. You must please to reserve his for next$N parliament and get it timely in. We shall on Monday accompany your present$N to the General. We have his to Major Smith$N                    We are.

Post office and attainder. We have delivered your$N letters to Mr. Hilyard with words of civility. We have agreed to treat$N with him upon Monday. We shall be very shy to acquaint him we$N have power to conclude with him. For your security is perfectly good$N in law. We believe it was given you by the parliament in compensation$N of great losses you sustained in the war. It concerns you much being$N in the midst of your town. We can not but consider that he has$N a brother captain in your garrison and that this gentleman also has$N employed his interest since he was in this parliament to continue you$N a garrison. We hope you will be private in these things communicated$N to you out of faithfulness to your interest and that you will not be$N hasty in your resolutions nor open one way or other. We shall treat$N fairly with him and advertise you from time to time what is proposed.$N Mr. Wilson is returned down this week and has as far as we perceive$N effected nothing one way or other but Mr. Stiles procured a presentation$N in his own name for Leeds.

(My Lord Bellasis is coming down within three$N or four days). But indeed we perceive that my Lord Bellasis was<p. 12$N very little informed by Mr. Hebird wherein or in what way he should$N befriend him, neither has Mr. Hebird in all this time ever been with$N either of us who might then have afforded our assistance.

If it be$N negative your own judgements will easily perfect it better out of that$N matter couched in our former letter. If otherwise, it is much easier.$N The house has sent up to the Lords the bill for review of the poll and $N the two bills for the two moieties/*halves of the excise. But that for foreign$N and inland commodities is not yet out of doubt with us. That for$N 6 months assess/*assessment is well-nigh finished. And we have given his Majesty$N yet one month assess more to buy jewels for his crown and a jewell$N of 1000 pounds to Colonel Windam who was very instrumental in his Majesty's$N escape. We do not perceive but that we shall rise at our day. Here is$N a conspiracy detected against his majesty's person. Major White was$N a principal in it and reveals others.

For this day and tomorrow we have adjourned. Yesterday$N (the excise of beer and ale being otherwise expired) his Majesty$N came about noon to the Lords’ House and passed only those two bills$N of the two moieties/*halves of that excise. The one bill taking the Court$N of Wards and the duty of purveyance for one moiety in perpetuum.$N The other bill giving the other moiety/*half to his Majesty for life towards$N the making up of his whole yearly revenue 1200000 pounds.  The bills for$N wine licences. For the post, for review of the poll, for 6 months$N assessment, for one month sessment towards expense of coronation,$N for arrears of twelve and three months assessment, for arrears of$N excise are all ready but not yet passed. The excise of foreign and inland<p. 13$N commodities it is hoped may now fall to the ground. Yet before we$N rise it will undergo a very stiff debate on both sides by reason of some$N public debts formerly secured and others desired to be added there$N upon. The jealousy is least this excise should also be perpetuated$N for there will never want public debts to be engrafted upon it. There$N has been a motion and likely to be renewed in the House for an act$N to empower commissioners to receive the voluntary benevolence of$N all persons through the country towards his Majesty's coronation. But$N we hope it will not take. For though nothing is too much for so$N gracious a prince as his Majesty has been all along to us, yet 'it is$N good to leave something to give hereafter and not to endanger the$N peoples good will by taking their benevolence. God has laid a soar$N affliction upon his Majesty’s family and therein upon the whole nation.$N The Princess of Orange died yesterday at his Majesty’s return from$N the Lords’ House having been some five days sick of the small pox or$N measles or spotted fever the physicians disagreeing whether.

For the kings menial servants or those which$N acted by instructions from the king, betraying their trust are excepted$N out of the act of indemnity. The House left Liddall to prosecute him$N at law. But I believe it will not signify much. Today, the committee$N having yesterday gone through the Act for Security of his Majesty’s$N person, all the amendments were read and agreed to and the bill put$N to engrossing. The committee for confirming the acts of the last$N parliament sat yesterday also and are carrying 100 pounds on that business but$N indeed the bill then passed for confirmation of ministers will I doubt$N undergo a very hard scrutiny; so that I think as I intimated to you$N in my last, whosoever have the business of their ministers in a present$N tolerable and secure posture had best make much of that and [not]$N expose themselves to a further hazard. I believe in this conjuncture$N I shall be left single in attempting any thing for your patronage$N notwithstanding the assistance you expected from some others. For$N so they signify to me. And I doubt you will hardly agree about the$N levying of your ministers maintenance. But in this thing according$N as I write to you must please to be very reserved and rest very$N much upon your own prudence. I would not have you suspect any$N misintelligence betwixt my partner and me because we write not to$N you joyntly as Mr. Ramsden and I used. For there is all civility$N betwixt us. But it was his sense that we should each be left to his$N own discretion for writing except upon some answer unto your letters$N and that to be jointly.

We are willingly quickened by you$N for the act of separation of your church from Hessel and thank you$N for what you contribute towards it in the papers you enclosed. Whereby$N there seems to us little to be wanting towards the expedition of that$N bill which is in good forwardness to be presented to the House but$N that you be pleased to deal with all those in your town who shall$N by this act be made contributory to such maintenance for your$N minister, for their general and particular consent towards it by their$N subscribing to a paper testifying their assent. For the parliament is$N always very nice and curious in this point of involving men in any$N assess/*assessment or contribution of this nature without their voluntary and$N express concurrence. Insomuch that this last parliament in a case$N of the like nature for Royston nothing could be done till that were$N first done, and the want of two or three hands concerned did put$N a stop for some time to that business. Though this seem something$N longsome to us and you who are equally desirous of the effect, yet$N nothing is long that is necessary, nor that time lost which makes the$N business at last go of clearer. That patent of ballast is grievous alike$N to all the ports and if we can pitch upon some common way to seek$N redress, with that modesty which is expedient where his Majesty's seal$N is in the case, we shall incite and join with those that have the$N same interest. As to your patent for the gauging of wines and your$N former power to grant four wine licences it shall be our care betwixt$N this and our next letter to give you a good account and do you the$N best service therein as in all other matters recommended by you or$N occurring to us. The newest matters here are the engrossing of the act$N for safety of the King’s person. The bill for the militia read once.

But if you had once got the consent and subscription$N of all those particular persons who are to contribute after$N the separation to the maintenance of your ministers (which can not$N neither properly be had but to a certain sum) you should then find$N for the rest that your bill should have as quick a dispatch as you or$N we can desire. In that matter of ballast we have spoken with the$N members of several ports who are sensible of that grievance and we$N are deliberating how to proceed therein either by petition to his$N Majesty for reversing the patent or else by a short act for that end.$N As for the patent for gauging of wines we think the sooner you send$N up your charter for that from king James that it may be renewed,$N the better you will do; and then will be the most natural time to$N take notice of that of Palmers. For your four wine licences by$N statute of Edward the 6th we have appointed a meeting with$N Mr. Recorder before the next post, and according as we shall upon the$N discussing of it find you more or less concerned, we shall in the bill$N for confirmation of public acts wherein also is that for wine licences,$N interpose for the preservation of your interest therein.

I cannot choose but be proud$N of being owned by so valuable a person as you are, and$N one whom all my inclinations carry me to honour and$N love at a very great rate, and you will find by the trouble$N I last gave you of this kind how impossible it will be<p. 39$N for you to be rid of an importunity which you have much$N encouraged and how much your late silence alarmed one$N that is so much concerned for the honour you do her$N in allowing her to hope you will frequently let her know$N she has some room in your particular favour, I hope you$N have pardoned me that complaint and allowed a little$N jealousy to the great passion I have for you and that$N I shall with some more assurance come to thank you$N for this last favour of 12th instant, and must beg you$N to believe that if my convent were in Cataya and I a$N recluse by vow to it, yet I should never attain mortification$N enough to be able willingly to deny myself the great$N entertainment of your correspondance, which seems to$N remove me out of a solitary religious house on the moun_tains $N and place me in the most advantageous prospect$N upon both court and town and give me right to a better$N place than of either, and that madam is your friendship,$N which is so great a present, that there is but one way$N to make it more valuable and that is by making it less$N ceremonious and by using me with a freedom that may$N give me more access into your heart and this beg from$N you with a great earnestness, and will promise you that$N whatsoever liberties of that kind you allow me, that I will$N never so much abase that goodness as to press mine own$N advantages further than you shall permit or lessen any$N of the respect I owe you, by the less formal approaches$N I desire to make to you who though I esteem above most$N of the world yet I love yet more.$N I believe ere this you have seen the new Pompey$N either acted or written and then will repeat your partiality $N to the others, but I wonder much what preparations$N for it could prejudice Will Davenant when I hear they$N acted in English habits and that so a propos that Cesar was$N sent in with a feather and a staff till he was hissed off the$N stage and for the scenes I do not see where they could$N place any that are very extraordinary but if this play has$N not diverted the citizens’ wives enough Sister W. D. will$N make them amends for they say Harry the 8th and some$N later ones are little better than puppet plays. I understand<p. 40$N the confederate translators are now upon Heraclins and$N I am contented that Sir Thomas Clarges who hath done$N that last year, should adorn this triumph in it as I have$N done in Pompey, for I defy Heraclius and all his works,$N having so unfortunately piqued Mr. Waller that he was$N pleased to speak of me with as little generosity to the King$N as he once did of Sacharissa to the Parliament and I fear$N his displeasure is no wit abated since the King's and$N Queen's so gracious reception of those verses you mention$N upon her majesty's recovery and though this advantageous$N opinion might have given me some vanity yet I'll assure$N you Madam yours gave me more and though I never wrote$N anything with more distrust of myself that since you think$N them worthy of so favourable a mention I will submit my$N judgement to you and rather think it possible that I might$N hit something in them not unluckily than that you could$N be unsincere to one you are pleased so generously to own.$N You see how much I depend upon what you say and$N therefore you ought in honour never to use me with$N compliment.$N I am glad of the news of the Duchess's recovery and$N the other victory you mention at Court for though it be$N but changing our pack of cards for another yet time and$N inconstancy together may at last fix that passion where it$N ought to be.

I do not admire his style, nor emulate$N the spirit of discontent which runs through all his$N letters. There is a lucky hit in reputation which$N some obtained by the defect in their judges, rather$N than from the greatness of their merit; the contrary$N may be instanced in Doctor Donne, who had$N he not been really a learned man, a libertine in wit$N and a courtier, might have been allowed to write$N well, but I confess in my opinion, with these qualifications$N be falls short in his letters of the praises$N some give him.$N Voyages seems to excel both in quickness of$N fancy, easiness of expression, & in a facile way of$N insinuating that he was not ignorant of letters, an$N advantage the court air gives persons who converse$N with the world as books.$N I wonder at nothing more than at the ambition$N of printing letters; since, if the design is to produce$N wit and learning, there is too little scope for$N the one, and the other may be reduced to a less<p. 431$N compass than a sheet of gilt paper, unless truth$N were more communicative. Businesses, love, accidents$N secret displeasure, family intrigues, generally$N makes up the body of letters, and can signify very$N little to any besides the persons they are addressed$N to, and therefore must lose infinitely by being exposed$N to the unconcerned. Without this declaration$N I hope I am sufficiently secure never to run$N the hazard of being censured that way, since I cannot$N suspect my friends of so much unkindness, nor$N myself of the vanity to wish fame on so doubtful$N a foundation as the caprice of mankind. Do not$N impute my silence to neglect; had you seen me$N these ten days continually entertaining persons of$N different humour, age, and sense, not only at meals,$N or in the afternoon, or the time of a civil visit, but from$N morning till night, you will be assured it was impossible$N for me to finish these few lines sooner; so$N often have I set pen to paper and been taken off$N again, that I almost despaired to let you know$N my satisfaction that Jack complies so well with$N your desires, and that I am your friend and$N servant,$N M.

It cannot be the effect of his$N discernment which makes him give sentence in my$N behalf, being such a great master of reason as he is;$N but it is certainly a mark of his great kindness to$N you that be defers to your judgment in opposition to$N his own. I should not question yours in other things,$N but the wisest may be allowed some grains, and I$N conclude you no less a courtier than a philosopher.$N Since my last to you I have seen "The Siege of$N Grenada," a play so full of ideas that the most refined$N romance I have ever read is not to compare with$N it: love is made so pure, and valour so nice, that$N one would imagine it is designed for a Utopia rather$N then for our stage. I do not quarrel with the poet,$N but admire once born in the decline of morality$N should be able to feign such exact virtue; and as$N poetic fiction has been instructive in former ages,$N I wish this the same event in ours. As to the strict<p. 433$N law of comedy I dare not pretend to judge; some$N think the division of the story not as well as if it$N could all have been comprehended in the day’s actions;$N truth of history, exactness of time, possibilities$N of adventures, are nicest the ancient. Critics$N might require; but those who have outdone them$N in fine notions may be allowed the liberty to express$N them in their own way, and the present world$N is so enlightened that the old dramatic must bear$N no sways. This account perhaps is not enough to$N do Mr. Dryden right, yet is as much as you can$N expect from the leisure of one who has the care of$N a nursery.$N I am, Sir, &c.$N M.

We may not reproach our own, since$N here is at this present a scene for gallantry and$N merit, and while we may hope, we must not condemn.$N Should I tell you how full of sorrow I$N have been for the loss of Dr. Bretton, you only$N would blame me; after death flattery ceases, therefore$N you may believe there was some cause to lament$N when thousands of weeping eyes witnessed$N the affliction their soles were in; one would have$N imagined every one in this parish had lost a father,$N brother, or husband, so great was the bewailing;$N and in earnest, it appears there has never been a better$N nor a more worthy man. Such was his temper,$N prudence, charity, and good conduct, that he gained$N the weak and preserved the wise. The suddenness<p. 439$N of his death was a surprise only to his friends; as$N for himself it might be looked upon as a deliverance$N from pain, the effect of sickness, and I am$N almost persuaded God snatched him from us, at least$N he might have been prevailed with by the number$N of petitions to leave him still amongst us. If$N you suspect kindness in me make me speak too$N much, Doctor Parr is a person against whom$N you cannot object; it was him, who preached the funeral$N sermon, and as an effect of truth as well as$N eloquence he himself could not forbear weeping$N in the pulpit. It was his own expression that there$N were 3 for whom he had infinitely grieved, the martyred$N king, my lord Primate, and doctor Bretton;$N and as a confirmation of the right that was done$N to him in that oration, there was not a dry eye nor a$N dissenting person.

V, pp. 433-435.$N To Mr. Bohun at Oxford.$N Sir,$N Do not think my silence hitherto has proceeded$N from being taken up with the diversions of the$N town, the éclat of the wedding, masquerades which$N trebled their number the second night of the wedding$N [so] that there was great disorder and confusion$N caused by it, and with which the solemnity$N ended; neither can I charge the housewifery of the$N country after my return, or treating my neighbours$N this Christmas, since I have never found any business$N or recreation that makes me forget my friends.<p. 434$N Should I confess the real cause, it is your expectation$N of extraordinary notions of things wholly out$N of my way:  Women were not born to ready authors,$N and censured the learned, to compare lives and$N judge of virtues, to give rules of morality, and sacrifice$N to the muses.  We are willing to acknowledge$N all time borrowed from family duties is misspent;$N the care of children's education, observing$N a husband's commands, assisting the sick, relieving$N the poor, and being serviceable to our friends, are$N of sufficient weight to employ the most improved$N capacities among us. If sometimes it happens by$N accident that one of a thousand aspires a little$N higher, her fate commonly exposes her to wonder,$N but adds little to esteem. The distaff will defend$N our quarrels as well as the sword, and the needle is$N as instructive as the pen. A heroine is a kind$N of prodigy; the influence of a blessing star is not$N more dangerous, or more avoided. Though I have$N lived under the roof of the learned, and in the$N neighbourhood of science, it has had no other effect$N on such a temper as mine, but that of admiration,$N and that too but when it is reduced to practice. I$N confess I am infinitely delighted to meet within$N books the achievements of the heroes, with the$N calmness of philosophers, and with the eloquence$N of orators; but what charms me irresistibly is to$N see perfect resignation in the minds of men what$N ever happens adverse to them in their fortune; that<p. 435$N is being knowing and truly wise; it confirms my$N belief of antiquity, and engages my persuasion of$N future perfection, without which it was in vain to$N live. Hope not for volumes or treaties; raillery$N may make me go beyond my bounds, but when$N serious, I esteem myself capable of very little, yet$N I am, Sir,$N Your friend and servant,$N M.

Duke, who retired out of this life on$N St. Paul's day [25 Jan.] at midnight, and has changed$N the scene to him and us, and left occasion to all$N who knew him to bewail the loss. You need not$N to be made sensible by a character of a person you$N knew so well, and you can enumerate virtues enough$N to lament and shed some tears justly; therefore$N spares me the sorrow of repeating what effect it has$N wrought on such a mind as mine, who thinks no$N misfortune worth regretting besides the loss of$N those I love. Do not blame me if I believe it all most$N impossible to meet with a person so worthy in<p. 437$N himself, and so disposed to esteem me again;$N and yet that is not the chiefest cause of my affliction.$N I might wave much of my own interest, had$N I not so many partners that will suffer equally.$N These are the trials which make Christian philosophy$N useful, not only by a resignation to the Divine$N degree, but by that hope which encourages us$N to expect a more lasting happiness than any this$N world can give, without which we were extremely$N wretched, since no felicity here has any duration.$N The greatest conquerors themselves are subject to$N this unsteady state of human nature, therefore well$N I may submit, whose concerns are trivial in respect$N of others. Yet, this I conclude, that we die by degrees$N when our friends go before us. But while I$N to discuss this with you, I should consider what effects$N melancholy reflections may have on a splenetic$N person, one who needs not to cherish that temper.$N I will only add that I am now able to leave$N my chamber, which is more than I could do these$N 14 days and that I am, Sir,$N Your servant, M.

But as soon as it was made, several$N gentlemen moved not to proceed in it further but to expect some$N information more of the resolutions to come from Holland. This was$N long and frequently opposed by others. So that the debate terminated$N in a division of the House, the most numerous that I remember of$N many years wherein by 176 against 174 it was carried to proceed.$N Then the several paragraphs of the address were in order put to the$N question and upon two of the most material there were two divisions$N of the House. The first of 170 against 167. The second of 169 against$N 166. Both carried in the affirmative. And the whole address as$N I send it you was agreed and the members of the Privy Counsel$N ordered to desire of his Majesty the time when the House might wait$N upon him with it. It was then moved that the Houses vote against$N Duke Lauderdale that his Majesty may further humbly be desired to$N remove him from his Counsels and presence might be added to this$N address, the House having rejected the other day the particular form$N in which it was drawn up. This admitting a debate and the House$N having already sat the whole day till five a clock, some moved to$N adjourn, which came at last to be the question and the House being$N divided upon it, it was carried by 158 against 150 not to adjourn.$N So they proceeded on and it was without any division more voted to$N add him to the address. It happened in one of the former divisions$N that on some occasion in the lobby there were blows given between$N Sir Thomas Chichley, Master of the Ordinance and the Lord Obrian$N though both of the same party. The House ordered Sir Thomas who$N was present and the Lord Obrian who absented to be taken into custody$N of their sergeant at arms. Today a verbal message as from the King$N was delivered by secretary Williamson that he would receive their address<p. 225$N in the afternoon and to enter immediately into consideration of a$N supply. This last was long debated none being willing to give a$N negative but neither forward to an affirmative in the uncertainty$N of war or peace. Both were avoided by the question whether the$N debate should be adjourned which past by 168 against 167 in the negative$N and so fell. They with their address waited since on the King$N who seemed dissatisfied. God grant better.$N                                 I am your servant$N                                     Andrew Marvell.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 444<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster, London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Hull Corporation<PLace of recipient: Kingston upon Hull<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Gentlemen my very worthy friends<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1678<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to unnamed gentlemen (1678),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

For his Majesty$N sent up for the Commons to the House of Lords and prorogued the$N parliament till the twenty third of this month. You know that$N always upon prorogation whatsoever business was imperfect and$N depending is quite cut off and if the parliament intend to proceed$N again upon it, they must resume all from the very beginning. One$N thing you may please to take notice of that the cornclause is by the$N period of this session expired. Also this prorogation having thus$N happened and if there should be a peace, it is now in the King and$N parliament’s power to revoke the French prohibition next meeting.$N It is probable the continuance of the additional duty on French and$N other wines may then to be considered. I doubt not but many will$N reflect upon this prorogation for other reasons. But they that discourse$N the lest and think the best of it will be the wisest men and the best$N subjects. God in mercy direct his Majesty always to that which may$N most conduce to his own and the Kingdom’s happiness. I remain$N gentlemen etc.$N                         Your most affectionate servant$N                                Andrew Marvell$N    Westminster May. 14. 1678.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 445<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster, London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Hull Corporation<PLace of recipient: Kingston upon Hull<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Gentlemen my very worthy friends<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1678<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to unnamed gentlemen (1678),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

And after that the Lord Chancellor spoke at large, but the$N copy of it not having been communicated to the House of Commons,$N they appointed a committee to peruse the Lords Journal for it, where$N such things are of course to be entered. The Lords have also ordered$N the speech to be printed: so that I suppose one way or other I may$N by the next post compose it for you. The House of Commons opened<p. 226$N their session as is usual with reading a bill and that which was pitched$N upon was the former bill for regulating the collection of hearthmoney$N and then they appointed a day for its second reading. The rest of their$N time was spent in settling the ordinary affairs of their House appointing$N days for their grand committees, naming and empowering their$N committee of privileges, and renewing the clause against bribery or$N entertainments in order to elections and lastly in receiving several$N petitions concerning undue elections. What I remark in the House$N is that it is much fuller than ordinary and more are still upon the road$N and there seems a more than usual concernment among all men as if$N some great and I hope good thing were to be expected. God in his$N mercy direct all to the best. What I understand thereof I shall from$N time to time communicate to you, remaining gentlemen etc.$N                             Your most affectionate servant.$N                                  Andrew Marvell$N Westminster May 23. 1678--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 446<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster, London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Hull Corporation<PLace of recipient: Kingston upon Hull<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Gentlemen my very worthy friends<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1678<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to unnamed gentlemen (1678),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

The bill for encouragement of the woollen manufacture,$N which was in progress last session, was read the first time. They also$N appointed a committee to bring in a bill or bills to hinder the growth$N of Popery. Also a committee to inspect the laws concerning the$N poor in order to rectify them. Several things of the like public and$N good intention were set on foot again which I shall be glad to see come$N to perfection. Today (which was intended though not ordered for$N consideration of his Majesty’s and the Chancellor’s speech) but the$N morning being most part spent before the speeches were published,$N there was a motion made for an humble address to his Majesty to$N know of him the state of affairs as they now stand in relation to war$N or peace: and that if his Majesty shall think fit to enter into a war$N with the French King, with the assistance of the Emperor and such$N other Princes and states as shall come into the confederacy, this$N House will support and assist his Majesty in the carrying on the war.$N xxxThis debate took up the whole day forasmuch as some counted this$N address to be unseasonable when it appeared that all things abroad$N were so disposed toward a peace; some thought it more requisite to$N proceed first of all to the disbanding of the army; others, that it$N were best to lay by all apprehensions and jealousies and to furnish<p. 227$N the King with money, leaving the rest to his Majesty's discretion. In$N this variety of opinions the House came about four a clock to a$N question of adjourning the debate which was carried in the affirmative$N by 195 against 176. In general what I learn by information both$N within and without doors is that both Holland and Spain appear$N to be agreed upon terms with France. I have enclosed the speeches.$N I remain gentlemen etc.$N                             Your most affectionate servant$N                                   Andrew Marvell.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 447<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster, London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Hull Corporation<PLace of recipient: Kingston upon Hull<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Gentlemen my very worthy friends<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1678<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to unnamed gentlemen (1678),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

They then received the report$N of the accounts of the 200000 pounds taken upon the clause for credit upon$N the excise and voted first upon a division of 139 to 131. That it does$N appear to this House that an 160000 pounds has been borrowed on the$N excise and has been expended on the extraordinary charge of the$N navy. Next, upon division of 149 to 142. That it appears that$N 40000 pounds has been borrowed on the excise and expended for the extraordinary$N charge of the ordinance in the year 1677. Today$N being the last on which any new motion could be made for supply his$N Majesty commanded the House to wait on him in the House of Lords$N when he spoke long to them but it has been impossible for me to$N send you a copy of the speech, the House having sat all day till seven$N in the evening. But the most remarkable point was that his Majesty$N desired beside these supplies already in prospect, to be further furnished$N with an additional revenue for his life of 300000 pounds a year, on$N which condition he would appropriate 500000 pounds a year to the navy.$N Also 40000 pounds for the Princess of Orange's portion. And signified there$N might be a recess toward the middle of the next month. They$N first voted thanks to be presented by the Privy Counsel for the$N gracious expressions in his speech. Then after long debate they$N voted without trying the division that they would not go into committee$N of the House for raising a revenue of 300000 pounds a year for his$N Majesty's life. Then that they would not consider of any compensation$N for the French Prohibition; the revenue not having as yet suffered$N by it. This carried by 202 against 145. But next, to go tomorrow$N into a committee of the whole House to consider of the motion for$N continuing the imposition on wines; as also of the way of raising the$N 200000 pounds to which they are obliged and the other 2 or 300000 pounds for the$N charge of this fleet, and to consider the motion for 40000 pounds portion.$N From hence, these things being thus settled they entered into a great$N debate of looking into the Privy Seals for secret service since 1 of<p. 233$N May 77. and of taking account what pensions on the revenue.$N And then of a test for the members that they had not been bribed$N and a great many heads more. It was late but carried not to adjourn$N by 173 against 103. Then at last the question was put for a committee$N to draw up such a test. It fell by a division of 100 to 86. I remain$N gentlemen etc.$N                         Your most affectionate servant$N                              Andrew Marvell.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 448<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster, London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Hull Corporation<PLace of recipient: Kingston upon Hull<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Gentlemen my very worthy friends<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1678<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to unnamed gentlemen (1678),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

The House sat the most$N part of the day in committee of the whole House upon the matters$N of supply which I mentioned formerly. And in conclusion they agreed$N (not reckoning in the 200000 pounds already past for the disbanding the$N army) that in discharge of the 200000 pounds  borrowed on the excise, and$N of the extraordinary charge of the fleet, and for the payment of$N 40000 pounds  for the Princess of Orange’s portion there should be in all$N 414000 pounds  more raised. But of the way of  levying it there is yet$N nothing resolved though several things were propounded. Today,$N the bill for wearing of woollen and that against Papists sitting in$N either House of Parliament were both reported and ordered to be$N engrossed. They should have went/*gone then again into committee about the$N way of raising this money: but the Lords having sent down the$N disbanding bill with some amendments, diverted it. The Lords have$N altered the last of June which the Commons had fixed for disbanding$N all the forces except those in Flanders to the 27th of July and given$N those in Flanders a further term as I remember, to the 24th of$N August. The debate did principally run upon the 27th of July$N and the Commons have voted that they disagree and have ordered$N a committee to prepare reasons of this disagreement to be presented$N to the Lords at a conference. They have resolved also to$N sit on Monday although it is a holiday; being very intent to$N dispatch all business as soon as possible for many members go$N daily away and all here are weary. In the copy of the late conference$N where it speaks that the states should have taken so much pains in$N vain etc. the word business ought to have been barrier. (that is$N a ledge of towns dividing the French and Spaniard.) I remain$N gentlemen etc.$N                     Your most affectionate servant$N                         Andrew Marvell.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 449<Author(s)/writer(s): Andrew Marvell, 1621-1678<Place of author: Westminster, London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (57)<Status of author: politician and writer<Recipient: Hull Corporation<PLace of recipient: Kingston upon Hull<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Gentlemen my very worthy friends<Relation of correspondents: distant<Ranks of correspondents: downwards<Exact date: 1678<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Andrew Marvell to unnamed gentlemen (1678),<The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell, ed.

Also the bill for continuing$N the new impost/*tax upon wines and vinegars has been read the first$N time. There was moreover a bill brought into day and once read for$N supplying certain defects in the French prohibition explaining the$N ships to be subject to seizure which fraudulently put into ports and lie$N there without apparent necessity, and making the informers part$N more certain and easy to come by etc. They sent also by some of their$N members to a conference with the Lords about the disbanding bill,$N a provision which they desired might in lieu of the Lords’ amendments$N be added to the bill: whereby in case any part of the army cannot$N be disbanded by the last of this month there may be more time$N allowed so that the whole do not exceed the terms in the bill above$N 30 days. I hear that the Lords are likely, although it comes so near$N to their own sense, yet to disagree in it. The House of Commons$N have both today and yesterday been in committee about the way of$N raising the other moneys. After several debates, concerning 200000 pounds $N to be raised on the new foundations since 1656 within ten miles of$N London; of making a second act for review of the pollbill; of$N laying a further tax upon land; the House has at last resolved$N (agreeing with the committee) that the 414000 pounds and no more shall$N be raised by the old way of subsidy. And they have appointed to go$N again tomorrow into committee in order to the further consideration$N of that method and toward preparing the bill for that purpose.$N                         I remain gentlemen etc.$N                              Your most affectionate servant$N                                  Andrew Marvell--$N June 25. --78.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 450<Author(s)/writer(s): Sir Thomas Browne, 1605-1682<Place of author: Norwich, East Anglia<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (74)<Status of author: nobility, author and philosopher<Recipient: Dr. Edward Brown<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: personal; D.S.

But he intends$N God willing to be in London on Tuesday next.$N I presume you have my letter which I then wrote; pray$N peruse it, and know that he says he has had some$N gleeting at the penis at times a great while; he came$N about Michaelmas last to Dr Blincolne and myself and$N he took some mercurial medicines and decoctions and$N diet drinks and grew well, as he said, only I understand$N from him that he is not free from gleeting sometimes$N and also has some inability as to erection.$N Therefore I would have you to view the penis diligently,$N and you may also take in my cousin Hobbs; he will stay$N about 3 weeks if thought fit for the use of any medicines$N or course. He intends to marry, and has settled$N affection upon a good gentlewoman and is in a manner$N agreed, but it were fit he should be in such a state of$N body as might be safe and congruous unto both. Consider$N therefore well of it and do all with the best secrecy$N possible, for he is very jealous and apt to be meticulous,$N and is hypochondriac. He is a fair conditioned$N gentleman and has a pretty good estate and not unlikely$N to be ungrateful, wherefore be careful of him and$N kind unto him and render to answer his doubts, and not$N to discourage him.$N    You say your book is like to be reprinted, probably$N the first part, not the second, which was printed since.$N Some additions would be made; I wrote one to you$N concerning Hippocrates that he practised in Thessalie$N and mentions divers patients of Larissa, and therefore<p. 134$N look out that paper, and if you have lost it give me$N notice for that is a material observation especially unto$N physicians and scholars.$N    It’s an odd passage concerning the French King’s$N getting Savoy and Piedmont into his hand for money,$N and it will concern many states and make them look$N about them. Though he had a good army, yet its$N thought he has prevailed much by his money in all$N the war and current of his affairs.$N    The rising in Scotland falls out unhappily at this time,$N many will wish that the parliament were sitting, but some$N jealous people will think that this may rather hinder$N their sitting.$N    I am glad the business succeeded so well at Halstead$N in Kent. Miles about London are short and 4 horses go$N far in a summers day. Sir Joseph Ash, whose daughter$N my Lord Townshend married, is a parliament man, but$N of the West country and about Bristowe. I knew well$N one Mr. Abraham Ashe who was a Russia merchant, who$N died near 30 years since, perhaps he might be$N related unto this family; it was a good FR_rencountre to$N meet with Mr. Ash who had travelled in those parts$N which you have described, and if he had read them$N might have been some light and information unto them.$N Mr. Soames may be recalled from Turin since the prince$N is dealing with the French about it.

Evelyn to Lady Tuke (1685),<Memoirs of John Evelyn, ed. Bray, vol. V, pp. 440-441.$N To Lady Tuke.$N April 1685.$N How to express the sorrow for parting with so$N dear a child is a difficult task. She was welcome$N to me from the first moment God gave her, acceptable$N through the whole course of her life by a thousand$N endearments, by the gifts of nature, by acquired$N parts, by the tender love she has ever showed her$N father and me: a thread of piety accompanied all$N her actions, and now proves out greatest consolation.$N The patience, resignation, humility of her$N carriage in so severe and fatal a disease, discovered$N more than an ordinary assistance of the divine goodness,$N never expressing fear of death, or a desire$N to live, but for her friends sake. The seventh day$N of her illness she discoursed to me in particular as$N calmly as in health, desired to confess and receive the$N blessed sacrament, which she performed with great$N devotion, after which, thought in her perfect senses to$N the last, she has never signified the least concern for$N the world, prayed often, and resigned her sole.—$N What shall I say!   She was too great a blessing for$N me, who never deserved anything, much less such$N a jewel. I am too well assured of your Ladyship’s kindness$N to doubt the part: you take in this loss; you have$N ever showed yourself a friend in so many instances,$N that I presume upon your compassion; nothing but$N this just occasion could have hindered me from well coming<p. 441$N you to town, and rejoicing with the best$N friend I have in the world—a friend by merit and$N inclination, one I must esteem as the wife of so$N worthy a relation and so sincere a friend as Sir Sam:$N (Tuke) was to me and mine. What is this world?$N when do we recall past things! What are the charms$N that keep our minds in suspense? Without the conversation$N of those we love, what is life worth?$N How did I propose happiness this summer in the$N return of your Ladyship and my dear child — for she was$N absent almost all this winter!$N She had much improved herself  by the remarks$N she had made of the world and all its vanities —$N what shall I add?  I could always speak of her, and$N might I be just to her without suspicion of partiality,$N could tell you many things. The papers which are$N found in her cabinet discover she was profited by her$N reading—such reflections, collections out of scripture,$N confessions, meditations, and pious notions,$N evidence her time was not spent in the trifling way$N of most young women. I acknowledge, as a$N Christian, I ought not to murmur, and I should be$N infinitely sorry to incur God's further displeasure.$N There are those, yet remaining that challenge my$N care, and for their sakes I endeavour to submit a$N for her kind concern, and wish she may live to be$N the comfort you deserve in her, that God will continue<p. 442$N the blessing to both, and make you happy$N which is the prayer of her who is$N Yours most affectionately,$N Mary Evelyn.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 457<Author(s)/writer(s): John Locke, 1632-1704<Place of author: Holland<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (54)<Status of author: philosopher<Recipient: Edward Clarke<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Sir<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1686<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<John Locke to Clarke (1686),<The Correspondence of John Locke and Edward Clarke, ed. Rand,<pp. 159-162.$N Sir,$N    I must confess I am extremely pleased I have done you$N any service in reference to your children. But do not think$N that those mighty thanks you heap upon me for it in your last$N ought to make me forget the solid obligations I have to you.$N For after all that you do or can say in magnifying this essay of$N mine, I must consider it as but a faint offer at some kind of$N acknowledgement for your favours; and I beseech you to receive$N it as such from one who wishes for nothing more than the of opportunities$N of showing how sensible he is of them. Upon this$N confidence, and the good success you assure me our method has$N hitherto had, I venture to trouble you with the remainder of my$N thoughts on that subject, and in this one more long sheet you$N will find I am come to the end of my tether. For having conducted$N my young master to the age when he will be got out of$N the hands of masters and tutors, we are at the bounds of what is$N [said] to concern education. I do not pretend, though I am now$N come to the conclusion, that I have given you a just treatise$N on this matter. There are a thousand other things that may$N need consideration; especially if one should take in the various$N tempers, different inclinations, and particular defaults, that are$N to be found in children, and prescribe proper remedies to each$N of them. But in this tumultuary draft I have made for your$N son, I have considered him barely as white paper, as a piece of$N wax, to be moulded and fashioned, and therefore have only$N touched those heads, which I judged necessary to the breeding$N of a young gentleman of his condition in general. And though$N I have with a great deal of freedom given you my opinion concerning$N all those things that came in my thoughts, and appeared$N material, yet I am too sensible of my want of experience in this$N affair, and the oversights I am liable to, to think that I have$N writ approaches anything more perfect even in that kind. You$N must not, therefore, though I am come to the end, look on it as$N a treatise, which I put into your hands for complete. It is well$N if being writ (as it has been) by scraps at distant times and<p. 160$N places, it will hold together and be of a piece. What parts you$N find I have either wholly omitted, or too slightly touched on,$N I desire you to remind me of. For since I shall not scruple to$N trouble you with anything else on this subject, which may at any$N time hereafter come into my thoughts, you may be sure I shall$N much more readily do so, when you shall set me on work, or$N propose any new matter you shall find wanting, which your care$N and concern for your dear little ones cannot (I conclude) fail to$N suggest to you in abundance: it being a fate that usually attends$N the speculations, which contemplative men have pleased themselves$N with in their studies, to be found very defective when they$N come to be put in practice.$N   As to remedies for peculiar disorders, the account you give$N me of your son makes me think I shall have little to say on that$N occasion. You will not suspect I flatter you, when I say his$N temper is as one could wish, and the love of reason he shows in$N his inquiries and discourses is as much to be preferred to that$N prattling quickness, which we are apt to be delighted in with$N children, as a healthy, well-made boy is to a gaudy suit; and if$N it were necessary there I think I could show you that that witty$N pertness that appears sometimes so early proceeds from a principle$N that seldom accompanies a strong constitution of body, or$N ripens into a strong judgement of mind. And if you desire to$N have him a more brisk talker, I believe I could teach you the way$N to make him so. But I find you had rather your son should be$N able and useful when a man, the pretty company and diversion$N to others whilst a child, though if that, too, were to be considered,$N I think I may say there is not so much pleasure to have a child$N prattle agreeably as to reason well. Encourage, therefore, his$N inquisitiveness all you can by satisfying his demands and  inform$N his judgement as far as it is capable. When his reasons are any$N way tolerable, let him find the credit and commendation of it.$N and when they are quite out of the way, let him without being$N laughed at for his mistake be gently put into the right, and can$N take care as much as you can that in this inclination he shows to$N reason about everything, nobody balk or impose upon him.$N For when we have all done, the right improvement and exercise$N of that faculty is the highest perfection of a man, and furnishes$N all the true light which our minds can attain unto.$N    I have formerly mentioned Æsop's Fables, or some such other<p. 161$N book of pleasant stories to draw him on with delight in reading.$N I now add that, if it be possible, you should get it with pictures,$N which will in a temper like his (that if I mistake not is much more$N pleased with things than names) make the learning of characters$N and words go down much easier when he sees there is some use$N of it, and that the knowledge of beasts and birds and such other$N things comes along with it those visible objects children heard$N talked of in vain and without any satisfaction whilst that have$N no ideas of them. If therefore Æsop‘s Fables, or some such other$N book, cannot be got with pictures, yet at least get him what$N pictures of animals you can, with the names of them, which at$N the same time will encourage him to read, and afford him matter$N of enquiry and knowledge.$N    If you find it with difficulty to meet with such a tutor as we$N desire, I do not at all wonder. I can only say, spare no care nor$N cost to get such an one. All things are to be had that way: and$N I dare assure you, that if you get a good one, you will never$N repent the charge; but you will always have the satisfaction to$N think it the money, of all others, the best laid out. But be$N sure take nobody upon friends, or charitable, no, nor great$N commendations. Inform yourselves thoroughly whether he be$N for your purpose, and when you find him every way, so get him$N at any rate. But whether he be such an one as I have formerly$N mentioned, and your design will need, you alone can judge;$N nor will the reputation of a sober man with learning enough$N (which with others is all usually that is required in a tutor) serve$N your turn. In this choice be as curious as you would be in that$N of a wife for him. For you must not think of trial, or changing$N afterwards; that will cause great inconvenience to you, and$N greater to him. When I consider the scruples and cautions I$N here lay in your way, methinks it looks as if I advised you to$N something which I would have you offer at, but in effect not do.$N but you know how much I am in earnest in this point; only you$N will understand me aright, if you think it a business you ought to$N be very nice in. When you have pitched on one, after having had$N him awhile with you tell me what kind of a man he is, I will then,$N the best I can, tell you what kind of use you are to make of him.$N    As to the business with Stratton I have nothing to say, but$N leave it wholly to your judgement, for so as you determine I$N know it will be well.<p. 162$N    Present my humble service to Madam, and tell her I am glad$N the little ones follow so well the footsteps of their mother, that$N they begin to have a reputation so early. I wish her and them$N health that she may long enjoy that growing satisfaction. I$N wish you with them all happiness, and am,$N                           Sir,$N                                   your most humble servant,$N                                           John Locke.$N 15th march.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 458<Author(s)/writer(s): John Locke, 1632-1704<Place of author: Holland<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (54)<Status of author: philosopher<Recipient: Edward Clarke<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Sir<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1686<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<John Locke to Clarke (1686),<The Correspondence of John Locke and Edward Clarke, ed. Rand,<pp. 162-165.$N Amsterdam, 4th may, 1686.$N Sir,$N      The manner wherewith you continue to speak of the advice$N I have ventured to send you concerning your son, makes me fear$N that in perusing it you more regard the intention and friendship$N of the author, than the meanness of the thing itself; since you$N so far mistake it as to think that it has laid the debt on your$N side, and such an one as you imagine you can never get out of;$N which, when I on the other side consider your favours, I conclude$N I have all the reason in the world to say in your own words,$N that I must forever remain your debtor. But to enter into a$N dispute with you, wherein an excess of friendship makes you$N obstinate, I have another reason to suspect that your consideration$N for the person that gave it makes you overlook many things$N in the advice itself, since that I receive not from you any objections$N about any part of it. For though I must own it is according$N to the best of my skill, and though I know the affection I writ it$N with to be very sincere, yet I can by no means fancy my opinion$N infallible, or that it should in all things so exactly jump with$N yours and madam's, that you should find nothing (in what is$N already put in practice) to be added, omitted, or altered, whereof$N however you say nothing at all. For I doubt not but when$N I revise the foul copy, which I keep by me on purpose, I shall$N myself find occasion for additions or alterations.$N    I do not at all wonder that you have not yet found a tutor$N to your mind, and I confess the truth somewhat pleased with it.<p. 163$N Not that you are hitherto disappointed, but that I perceive that$N you are more curious in your choice than to take up a venture$N with the first or second that comes in your way. It is of great$N consequence to your son, and therefore you cannot be too nice$N in it. If you could get your cousin to Chipley, a sober, well$N conditioned young man with moderate learning would do the$N business, but you know his humour and how averse to trouble$N especially of some kind.$N    But as to the law suit I mentioned in my last, I conclude$N upon second thoughts that it is best to let it perfectly alone$N without meddling at all in it, any farther than Earl Pembroke$N himself shall of his own accord discourse of his own concerns$N and give his advice about it, and then it would perhaps be not$N amiss to enquire and reason with him for your own satisfaction$N of the grounds he proceeds on.$N    As to your Carolina affair, I remember the owner told me it$N was a Landgraveship of fortyeight thousand acres of land, and$N the privileges thereunto belonging, which are to be seen in the$N fundamental constitutions. This is enough for your Scotch$N friend to know to see to what terms he will come, which, when$N they are judged reasonable or near the matter, the patent now$N in the executors' hands will be forthcoming, time enough, if the$N mice have not eaten it, as I believe not, in a strong wooden$N chest where he was wont to keep it, and which Adrian had the$N direction to open, which I remember was this: You must turn{figure}$N the key with the sun once round and a quarter, and then turn$N it back again half a round and so let it stand. For example, the$N key put in at the keyhole a must be turned by b-c-d quite to b$N again, and from b be turned back again to d, and there let stand,$N and then the lid of the chest may be lifted up. [This] I am sure is$N the just quantity of the motion that the key must have, and I<p. 164$N think for making it you must begin the motion with the sun;$N but this I do not perfectly remember, and therefore nothing must$N be forced in the case, for if the contrary motion from a to d and$N so round be the way to open it, you must do the quite contrary$N in all things. When it is open you will find one turn to lock it$N as it does other locks.

This I only know, that if you can persuade$N my cousin somerton and his wife to make use of it and$N remove thither (which I should advise him to if the plantation$N flourishes and promises any good), he may have this interest for$N acceptance.$N    As you are content your pictures should remain in the hands$N of the merchant here that bought them for you, till you have$N informed yourself concerning that sort of merchandise, and to$N what port either London or Exeter you were best have them,$N so I find he is not in haste for the slate of the account between$N you, which therefore you need not be at the pains to send till$N he demand it. He hopes, as I perceive, that this shall not be the$N last business he shall have with you, and therefore expects not$N to have the just balance returned, but an entire sum, something$N near it may serve the turn. The rest, I perceive, he is not$N troubled should remain as a nest egg till a farther occasion: as$N much as I know of him he is a very fair conditioned man, and$N knows very well your character.$N    I am glad to hear my Lady King's son thrives so very well,$N but the Lady I meant is a relation of the Lady that did me the$N honour to remember to me in your last. Pray present my$N humble service to her, and let her know I should be glad if there$N were anything here for her service. My service also to my$N Valentine Susan, and her man Thomas, and to all you mention$N in your last letter.$N    Sutton business dissatisfies me mightily. If that estate will$N yield nothing by the year, I am of opinion you should sell it and$N make present money of it; at least the very proposition will$N quicken the man that deceived you and your aunt so scurvy.$N    My most humble service to your Lady and little ones.$N                             I am, Sir,$N                                your most humble servant,$N                               John Locke<p. 165$N    I hope you will talk at large and fully with Adrian.

Rand,<pp. 166-170.$N 31st Oct. 1686.$N Sir,$N    Though I have taken so much pains in my business,$N and recovered more of haroll than I expected or I believe I$N should have done had I been there myself, yet it is to be doubted$N whether you will permit me to give you thanks. But whatever right$N you think you have particularly to do me all the kindness$N imaginable, I crave leave to be sensible of your favours, and to$N be sorry it lies not in my power to make acknowledgments that$N may bear any proportion with them, I could not forbear saying$N this much to you, and send you half a dozen lines of acknowledgment$N after you had spent the greatest part of twelve days in a$N most troublesome affair of mine. And therefore pray pardon me,$N and believe that I have no compliments for you, though I have$N all the true esteem and affection one friend can have for another.<p. 167$N I fear Mr. Stratton is but a slow man of London. I put something$N into one of my letters to you to quicken him. Whether you$N received it, or thought fit to make use of it, I know not. But in$N good earnest it were better that little tenement were reduced$N into money, than to yield no other income but trouble to me or$N my friends, though I doubt whether chapmen are there to be$N had.$N    I was sorry to hear by yours of 30th August of the death of your$N man. I suppose without the help of instances in your view you$N know of what value a trusty servant is.$N    Though I gave you an account by memorandum that I$N thought abele trees were to be got as good or better nearer home$N than from hence, it was not to spare myself the trouble of sending$N them, since I have not so much pleasure in anything as when$N I am doing you some service. I have therefore taken order to$N have some got for you, therefore pray take order with Mr.$N Ewell about them, for to him they will be consigned. With$N them you will also receive some Muscovy or Russian cabbage$N seed, and some blood red cabbage seed, which they look on here$N as the wholesome of all; and perhaps not without reason, for$N let me tell you this as a thing worth your remembrance, that it$N is one of the best remedies I know against the scurvy. Besides$N boiling of it, as we do our cabbage ordinarily, they use it here$N also raw as their constant winter salad, having always a store$N of them for the winter, which I am told the gardeners preserve$N by laying them in straw in deep holes dug into the ground on$N purpose. Their way of using them for salads is this: they take$N a cabbage and slice as much of it off as will serve for the present$N meal, just as you would slice a cucumber. Whereby the leaves$N being cut across fall into little shreds, which look handsomely in$N the dish, and dressed with oil and vinegar is no ill salad. And$N if you keep your counsel well I believe be scarce known what it$N is, and the truth is, being very wholesome, if I were there I would$N bring it into use under some fine new name, for after I had been$N a little accustomed to it I eat it with pleasure.$N    I wonder you had not heard by the 2nd of October of several$N sorts of seeds sent you by a neighbour of yours, and the third$N book De intellect humane sent by the same hand. Pray when$N you go to market enquire after them, if you have no news of$N them sooner.<p. 168$N    But to return to the abele trees, pray what do you mean by$N so great a number of them? It is true they are quickly up, but$N what are they good for when grown? If you cannot learn that$N the timber is good for something, I advise you to plant no more$N of them than you have need of for some present shade or shelter.$N For if they are not good timber, they are not beautiful; there is$N nothing recommends them but their quick growth, and for me$N I little value unless it be some present need things that are soon$N ripe and soon rotten. Indeed, I have heard that their boards are$N almost as good as deal for floorings of rooms and dry uses, but$N I doubt it. In a rich soil like yours where all things grow so well,$N I should choose to have a walk up to the front of the house of$N limes only for beauty, two rows of a side, and a space between$N them as broad as the front of your house, or ten or fifteen foot$N broader, as I formerly told you. But behind the house I would$N have a walk of the same fashion of elms, and on the sides of$N other useful trees (perhaps oak should be one), which will serve$N for beauty and use too, and pay for their standing. Abeles$N I would only place either where others will not grow, or where I$N have need of a present fence, and then I would place oaks amongst$N them, or behind them, which is better, which might do the$N business when they are gone: but not knowing your design,$N I talk at random though with a good intention.$N    Pray remember me to your Spa friends. Pray observe nicely$N without letting them perceive that you do so, how I stand in$N each of their books. We had some pleasant scenes here, which$N would come into the history of my travels, if I were with you to$N tell them.$N    The promise of lime tree seeds has failed me. The seeding man$N tells me the skipper brings word that he came too late to Norway.$N I fear this an excuse, for I had bespoke them before you writ$N to me, but what remedy? I must be content with a promise for$N another year.$N    I fear by your silence you are not yet provided of a man such$N as we sought for my young master. Let this (if it be so) in the$N meantime satisfy you, that none is much better than an unfit one.$N And if I knew what state he at present was in as to learning,$N I might perhaps think of some way, wherein he might under$N your eye improve sufficiently for his years without almost$N any trouble to you; and so the principles of virtue, sense and<p. 169$N breeding which are the main business be preserved and nursed$N up in the way you have begun, and not all these, as is used, be$N sacrificed to a little Latin under the management of an ill or$N imprudent tutor unskilled as it often happens in those essential$N points.$N    Though it has hitherto escaped my pen yet it has been often in$N my head, to enquire what course you took about your water,$N and whether you are supplied from the spring we examined$N when I was there. I have had many projects upon that affair$N in my head, though I never troubled you with any of them,$N hoping that your house is well supplied with good water without$N them.$N    Pray present my humble service to Madam. I had designed$N her a long letter by a Lady of her acquaintance I parted with$N not long since at the Brill. But finding that other people's$N letters were refused to be meddled with, I thought it good$N manners not to give the trouble of any of mine; so that the two$N Ladies were excused, one from carrying, and the other from$N reading a long letter from me. But pray tell her she has no$N great loss in it. For it being past doubt that I am her humble$N servant with the utmost affection and respect anybody can be,$N I had nothing to add to it but compliments for my being at that$N distance, which permits me not those opportunities of performing$N those parts of duty and gratitude belong to me, and enjoying$N sometimes at Chipley the company I most desire in the world.$N                             I am, Sir,$N                  your most obliged and most humble servant,$N                              John Locke.$N   Pray remember me to young master and my little pretty$N Mistress.$N                              J.$N    I take it something amiss that you have said nothing particularly$N of her to me this long time, but I am glad to hear from$N another hand that all your little ones thrive bravely, for so I am$N told in a letter I lately received. The news, you may believe,$N was very welcome, both because I have so much reason to love$N father and mother and all the family, and also I am glad to find$N that my plain rustic way of feeding and nursing children has not$N such hardships in it as to hurt even the tender sex. For I flatter<p. 170$N myself that Madam in breeding her daughters has inclined a$N little to my method.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 460<Author(s)/writer(s): John Locke, 1632-1704<Place of author: Holland<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: 40+ (54)<Status of author: philosopher<Recipient: Edward Clarke<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal; Sir<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1686<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<John Locke to Clarke (1686),<The Correspondence of John Locke and Edward Clarke, ed.

For there are so$N many repetitions in it, and so many things still misplaced, that$N though I venture it confused as it is to your friendship, yet I$N cannot think these papers in a condition to be showed anyone$N else, till by another review I have reduced them into yet better$N order. Though bating that, and the negligence of the style, you$N will find very little in the argument itself, that I think for the$N matter of it needs altering. Of what use it may be to any other$N I cannot tell, but if I flatter not myself, I has been of great help to$N our first enquiry, and the search of knowledge ever since has been$N in my thoughts, which is now five or six years. For so long ago$N is it since some friends upon an accidental discourse [started me]$N upon this enquiry, which I am not sorry for. And if it has cost$N me some pains in thinking, it has rewarded me by the light I$N imagine I have received from it, as well as by the pleasure of$N discovering certain truths, which to me at least were new.$N for being resolved to examine humane understanding, and the$N ways of our knowledge, not by others' opinions, but by what$N I could from my own observations collect myself, I have purposely<p. 178$N avoided the reading of all books that treated any way of$N the subject, that so I might have nothing to bias me any way,$N but might leave my thought free to entertain only what the$N matter itself suggested to my meditations. So that, if they at$N any time jump with others, it was not that I followed them; and$N if they differ it was not out of contradiction, or a mind to be$N singular. My aim has been only truth so far as my short-sightedness$N could reach it, and where I have misstated it in part or in$N the whole I shall be glad to be set right. Read it, therefore, as$N a friend's act, judge of it as a stranger's, and let me have your$N opinion with the greatest freedom, than which there can be$N nothing more obliging to$N                             Your most humble servant,$N                              John Locke.$N 31st December 1686.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 461<Author(s)/writer(s): Edward Clarke (of Chipley), landowner, 1655-1710<Place of author: London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: -40 (33)<Status of author: landowner<Recipient: John Locke<PLace of recipient: Holland<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal/personal; Dear Sir<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: upwards<Exact date: 1688<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Edward Clarke to Locke (1687/8),<The Correspondence of John Locke and Edward Clarke, ed.

And the other, which remains in$N marble paper, I shall also send by him to Mr. Freke about a$N fortnight hence, when he designs to go out of town, if I have no$N other opportunity by a safe hand in the meantime to convey it$N to him.$N    I have also gotten you a good beaver hat made by the$N diameter of the inside of the crown of the band exactly according$N to the dimension marked by the two black pins in your letter of$N the ninth instant. A peruke I have also bought for you, pursuant$N to your directions in the same letter, as near as possible$N as I could. And these, together with six flannel-shirts (bought$N and made up by your very good friend Mrs.. R.S.) and a cloak,$N which in the buying and making up I gave her my best assistance,$N I have sent hence by your old friend Adrian, who stayed but one$N day in town, and is this day set out from hence towards you,$N and it is possible may be with you as soon (or before) this can$N come to your hands.

But since there are so many$N accidents which may contradict my intentions in this particular$N I dare promise nothing; but trust on providence to send$N us a happy meeting, which I earnestly desire and long for. In$N the meantime give me leave to assure you that I will use all$N imaginable care and caution to find out the truth of what was$N done in that affair touching w p and my cousin, that in your$N last you mentioned to me.

Rand,<pp. 274-275.$N London, 5th June, 1688.$N DEAR SIR,$N    Saturday night last I returned hither from the West,$N and found my wife and children well here. I was with your$N cousin Stratton at Sutton Court, and at his own house about a$N fortnight since, but could not be so serviceable to you there as$N I designed by reason he had not, nor could not possibly (as he$N said) make out your account for me, but promised to return$N fifty pounds of your money hither to me with the first opportunity,$N and make his accounts perfect against my coming again$N into that country. There are generally great complaints of$N the difficulties to raise money amongst tenants, but I meet with$N none greater than those I have heard from Mr. Stratton, the$N tenants thereabouts being much worse than formerly, and (as$N he says) are grown so poor and scarce that unless they are permitted$N to have their rents left in their hands for a considerable$N time, and other advantages besides, there is not a tenant to be$N had for anything in these parts. By all which I presume there$N are some arrears greater than he was willing to tell me the$N particulars of at that time, especially having a prospect that the$N greatest part of them will be speedily gotten in. Mr. Stratton$N has followed the method I directed, and without any difficulty$N and trouble has got into his hands your lease to Robert Haroll$N of the homeclose at Beluton, etc, which will be a further$N security for what remains due from him to ... prevent him in$N his design of making such unreasonable advantages upon you$N as he intended by it.$N    My time at present will not permit me to give you a more$N particular account of your affairs in Somerset, but if I can be<p. 275$N so happy as to see you this summer, as I intended, you will$N then be more fully informed, but ever since I fixed my thoughts$N of that enjoyment, everything has seemed to conspire against me$N in it. First many cross accidents in my own affairs have happened$N besides the death of my Lady King, which brought me$N into a trust for her children. And immediately upon that the$N sickness and death of my cousin Clarke's lady here, he being at$N that time extremely ill, and since dead in the country leaving$N the care of his estate and four young children upon me, has so$N much increased my affairs and troubles that at present I can$N hardly see a way through them. But notwithstanding these$N and many other unexpected misfortunes that have happened,$N yet Madam and I are not totally without hopes of seeing you$N before we return into the West, if there be a possibility of my$N getting so much time as to come to you, which I most earnestly$N and heartily wish for.$N your friend Mrs.. R.S. is just now come in with your letter$N that came enclosed the last week to her for me, and gives you$N her real love and service, but at present the time will not permit$N me to answer any part of it. But you may be certain I will$N carefully perform what is therein desired, and answer it with the$N first opportunity, and for ever remain,$N      your most affectionate friend and faithful servant,$N                           E....$N Madam gives her service to you, etc.$N [Add.]: For Mr. Locke, these.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 463<Author(s)/writer(s): Edward Clarke (of Chipley), 1655-1710<Place of author: London<Sex of author(s): male<Age of author: -40 (33)<Status of author: landowner<Recipient: John Locke<PLace of recipient: Holland<SEx of recipient: male<ADdress of recipient: formal/personal; Dear Sir<Relation of correspondents: friends<Ranks of correspondents: upwards<Exact date: 1688<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: standard<Edward Clarke to Locke (1688),<The Correspondence of John Locke and Edward Clarke, ed.

But I can now$N inform you that I have spoken with Mr. Oakley, who tells me<p. 276$N that he pursued Adrian's orders with a blind obedience in that$N affair relating to R.B., and by letter has given you a particular$N account thereof. But by his discourse I have reason to doubt$N that matter was not managed exactly pursuant to the method$N directed by you; but all being over before my return to town,$N I was thereby altogether disabled from serving you in that affair,$N as otherwise I should have done. Mr. Oakley goes not out of$N town until Monday next, but gives his service to you and desires$N to know if you have received his letter.

But soon after my last of the 16th$N from Salisbury to you I was taken ill of an ague, with an ill fever$N that attended it, which so much weakened me that it was not$N without great difficulty I got hither, but by use of the Cortex$N Peruv.

But since it is laid upon me by the$N hands of an Almighty and gracious God that always proportions $N His punishments to the support He gives with$N them I may hope to bear it as a Christian ought to do,$N and more especially one that is conscious to herself of$N having in many ways deserved it.

TEMPLE.--------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 466<Author(s)/writer(s): Lady Giffard (1664-1722)<Place of author: Petworth, West Sussex<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: -40 (34)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Lady Berkeley<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: none<Relation of correspondents: close friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1698<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: London standard<Lady Giffard to Lady Berkeley (1698),<Martha Lady Giffard: her Life and Correspondence, ed.

Sept. 7, 14, 1698.$N We are got hither at last, and Papa I thank God$N very well, and so insufferably pert with winning 12$N guineas at Crimp last night. The Duke of Somerset$N says he never remembers seeing him better. We came$N on Monday in the evening and just before the Duchess$N had a letter from Lady Scarborough to tell her she went to$N London today for a fortnight, and intended to see me$N at Moore Park as she went by, so your charm is not yet$N ended which hindered us from meeting two summers, but$N I had a letter yesterday from her to desire that it may$N be when the Duchess of Somerset comes to stay there$N a fortnight, which is to be as soon as she returns from$N London and while the Duke goes to Marlborough. When$N she is there pray enquire a great deal of our East India$N ships with which she is concerned as well as I, and nobody$N can inform you better of what I most desire to know is$N whether I may take part of my share in what I like or$N must be obliged to have it all in money if it is divided which$N whether it be much or little to me would make a great$N difference. And now I must tell you what misfortunes$N have here befalled some of your friends and mine. My$N Lord Portland and Monsieur Overkerke I hear have had a$N quarrell at Loo, and the last they say treated him like a$N dog which I am apt enough to believe, for people are too$N apt to insult when one is falling and when nobody will$N help to right one. I believe one has seldom the heart$N to do anything towards it themselves, this they say has$N extremely exalted another person, and altogether it is$N thought more than my Lord Portland can bear altogether$N any longer, that he may not want a companion in his<p. 228$N afternoons, I hear that Mrs. Howard came the other day$N from ... where Mrs. Billingsly had order to take the care$N the children from her and when she came to my Lord of$N Essex' lodgings at London, she found a padlock. Upon$N that she could not get in which Mr. Billingsly said he had$N my Lord Essex's order for. You know whether I am$N rightly informed in all this, and pray send a yard of muslin$N for pinners and ten yards of crowsfoot to edge it with$N to Mrs. Hanbury before you leave town, the Duke and$N Duchess of Richmond dine here today and so my news$N and my letter are at an end together.$N Adieu I desire you will send word to East Sheene$N what is become of it, there is now no doubt of our being$N home to receive our letters on Friday.$N You never told me what became of ... --------------------------------------------------<Quid: numerus currens: 467<Author(s)/writer(s): Lady Giffard (1664-1722)<Place of author: Petworth, West Sussex<Sex of author(s): female<Age of author: -40 (34)<Status of author: nobility<Recipient: Lady Berkeley<PLace of recipient: London<SEx of recipient: female<ADdress of recipient: none<Relation of correspondents: close friends<Ranks of correspondents: equal<Exact date: 1698<Century (in quarters): 4/17<Educational background: educated<Dialect: London standard<Lady Giffard to Lady Berkeley (1698)<Martha Lady Giffard: her Life and Correspondence, ed.

I beg of God Almighty to support you$N and my father under it and that you would not neglect$N yourselves since it cannot at all be of any advantage to$N those we have lost and will be much the contrary to them$N that are left behind. If my Father cannot prevail with$N you to remove from that dismal place I will certainly see$N you there the beginning of next week in the mean time$N all you desired shall be speedily done. And I cannot end$N without making it my request that you should for my sake$N take some care of yourself and let not your trouble overcome$N you, which I am afraid it will do if you don't strive against$N it. I beg to have my humble duty presented to my Father$N whose affliction I am most heartily concerned for. I$N would myself have written to him but that two such letters$N are not to be written, I mightily desire that I may hear how$N you and your Father do and dear (Ant ?) remember your_self $N in thinking how many kind friends you have left$N which I am sure deserve your care, and some return for$N their concern for you. I wish I had gone down now with$N my Father but next week if it please God somewhere I$N will see you till when I shall not be easy.
